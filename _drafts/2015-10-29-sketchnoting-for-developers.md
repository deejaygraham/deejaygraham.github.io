Here is the companion post to my presentation at this year's [Developer Developer Developer North conference](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk). The [presentation slides are here](http://deejaygraham.github.io/sketchnoting-for-developers). 

## Abstract 
		
As developers the one thing we can count on is that we can never stop learning. 
Retaining, processing and making sense of new information are all parts of what 
we do every day. Sketchnoting is a set of techniques you can use to support 
and improve your visual thinking, communication and learning. You can even use 
it to get more benefit from the other sessions you attend at DDD North!

In this session, I will show you how sketchnoting works, how to get started, tips 
and tricks to save you time and why sketchnoting is so much better than F#. I'll 
also cover how it can be applied beyond conferences and talks to UX/UI design, 
team collaboration, agile methods and your personal development. 

## Agile

One of the big outward differences between "traditional" and agile teams is evidence of 
what we like to call "Big Visible Charts" or "Information Radiators".

These are big graphics on the walls of a team space that externalise the state of the 
team - ideas for new features, what's being worked on, progress towards goals, UI mock ups, 
burn downs, kanbans. These things are in line with XP's value of communication and 
the idea of "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools". Visuals, especially 
hand made ones, encourage interaction and conversation. 
 
Yet as a culture, children are not self-conscious when they draw, but as we grow up 
and get more "serious" and "professional" we are gradually encouraged to leave those 
childish things behind. Sometimes when we are asked for charts and visuals, we're tempted to 
reach for Excel or Visio to create our "professional-looking" artefacts.

Thankfully, techniques like Visual Thinking, Visual Problem Solving and Visual 
Notetaking/Sketchnoting are starting to be adopted by the agile community in all 
kinds of ways. This adoption, like most agile technqiues, is driven by their effectiveness 
for communication and learning, rather than tradition. 

It's caught on to such a degree in the agile community, sketchnoters are being hired to work 
at conferences, capturing content as a way of documenting the presentations beyond video.

At the most recent big "A" Agile conference in Washington D.C. some of the delegates put together 
their sketchnotes into an ebook that you can [download for free](http://kl.la/Agile2015LittleBook)

Atlassian (the company who make the Jira tool) are one example of a company who get everyone 
involved in conversations about how the software should look, behave, the priorities for work. 

All the work is made visible on walls around the business. They use visual techniques for 
brainstorming, working out problems from user stories and lots of others. 

"The winner is the best idea not the best artist".

I have to thank Jeff Patton, who consults for Atlassian, for letting me use some of his slides.

I'm a developer working in an agile team and I should be drawing and communicating more.

What I'd like to share with you is what I think of as the gateway drug, sketchnoting, and 
show your some techniques you can use at conferences and I hope you'll be inspired to try 
them out but also to use them in your personal and professional lives as well. 

# Something about...

Back in 2007 I attended a c++ conference in Oxford which included a track focussed on agile and 
lean - something the C++ community was just coming to realise was a thing. One talk was given 
by the fabulous Mary Poppendieck (picture) and it was a talk that changed my professional life.

Now developers had been aware of XP for quite a while, pair programming, CI, TDD etc. and at 
that time, the company I worked for were adopting lean production techniques for their hardware 
manufacturing and assembly but those concepts didn't make it upstairs to the software department. 

Mary's keynote helped me understand what lean concepts meant for software. I still have the 
notes but any other person reading them would not be able to tell you what they were about. 

It's only my memory that tells me that she was talking about the Toyota Production System, what 
"stop the line quality" means for software and how we should emulate the automated looms of the 
Toyoda Weaving mills of the late 19th and early 20th century.

Many more times over the years I have attended important events and promised myself that, this 
time, I'll take good, long form notes and definitely use them, they will be useful. But there 
they sit, still in a drawer, curling at the edges, yellowing slightly, unused and unloved. 
 
# A new hope

Someone who was equally frustrated with long form, hand-written or typed notes was 
Mike Rohde, a UX and design specialist in the US. Among Mike's credits are illustrations 
for books by 37 signals (picture). He started identifying alternative note-taking strategies 
in around 2006 and went on to literally write the book on sketchnotes in 2012.

In the book Mike defined sketchnotes like this:

"...rich visual notes created from a mix of handwriting, drawings, hand-drawn typography, 
shapes and visual elements like arrows, boxes and lines."

I should note that Mike didn't really invent any of these techniques, Visual Recording and 
Graphical facilitation have been a thing since the 70s (skill in themselves - lets group see their work, 
see connections, big picture and trends) and I think drawing as an art form has been going on 
longer than that. 


# Examples

So here are some examples of sketchnotes that I particularly like:

Rohde - pictures - paper
Veronica Erb
Makayla Lewis - uk
Eva-Lotta Lamm 
Guilia Forsyth 
Carolyn Sewell
Rachel Smith, Daniel Kirsch - ipad
Sasha Chua - Tablet
Jeanel King - Wall

# 3 - Why?

Sketchnoting, is really about making notes more memorable, it's where you are NOT trying to capture 
every word and every detail but trying to get the big picture (no pun intended), to get a 
higher-level conceptual understanding and integrate ideas. It also seems to be particularly suited to 
long-term recall (Kiewra & Fletcher 1984)

In ancient greece there are examples of stunning feats of memory and a number of writers compiled 
many techniques for remembering. Have you seen Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC reboot of Sherlock Holmes?
Here he's often shown standing using a memory palace technique? He has put things he wants to remember in 
order around an imaginary version of a physical place that is well known to him. He can then recall the facts 
at a later date by walking through his memory palace and recalling each of the items in their place. 

Today if you ask a magician or mentalist or a memory athlete how they remember so much stuff - the order of playing cards, 
people's names... they will tell you they use a few techniques (many invented by the greeks) which rely on making 
powerful associations between the (hard) thing they want to remember - the order of a deck of playing cards and 
something easy to remember like a story. One technique goes that you associate the face 
and the value of a playing card with an icon - the 10 of hearts is a goose, the king of diamonds is 
Albert Einstein, the 2 of clubs is the eiffel tower - and you tell yourself the story of Einstein chasing the goose 
around the eiffel tower (which is a much better thing for your mind to remember) to recall the order of the cards. 

Science seems to be on our side in this, there have been several studies in recent years that suggest longhand 
note-taking is better than keyboard, and visuals are better than text for information assimilation and recall.

Aside from the obvious distractions of facebook and twitter, email, IM etc, that come with an electronic device,
writing by hand seems to establish better links between what you are learning and your memory.

Williams & Eggert 2002 - found that the most effective way of taking notes is with an overall framework (the big picture) 
and embellished with critical specifics. That sounds an awful lot like sketchnotes.

In How Learning works in 2010 Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro et Al looked at the differences between how 
novices and experts form connections and found that experts often learn faster because they have a 
better understanding of the big picture and can put new facts into perspective more easily with known data.

"Use of drawing caters to individual learner differences,
as a drawing is shaped by the learners current or emerging ideas
and knowledge..."
Ainsworth Prain Tytler 2011

Dreyfuss Model?

There's also the Dual Coding Theory - Alan Paivio proposed the idea that hearing the word apple, a person can 
write the word and also draw a picture of the physical object. Doing this meant that person was more than twice 
as likely to recall information when asked about the apple later. It seems that the word and the icon are 
stored separately but linked and either can be used to recall the memory.

There something called the Pictorial Superiority Effect, PSE - tests 2500 pictures shown to a subject for less 
than 10 seconds each can recall 90% of them several days afterwards. This recall falls to around 60% a full 
year afterwards. The reason text alone works so badly is because the brain actually sees text as lots of tiny 
pictures and though it can group them together into patterns of words, it is still much less efficient than a 
good picture.

I have three children and all three have gone through the same experience. They have an essay to write. When it 
comes to checking it before submission they have all been too embarrassed to read it aloud to check for 
errors. So simple spelling mistakes, words get transposed, all things that get caught by reading aloud. It's often 
reading aloud that stops you skipping words or auto-correcting in your head and lets you spot the errors. It's like 
pair programming for essay writing.  

Who has a rubber duck on their desk at work? Or knows why you would have a rubber duck on your desk? 

Have you ever had the experience of banging your head against a problem for so long you can't tell which way is 
right anymore but stopping and finding someone to explain the problem to (even a rubber duck or stuffed animal) forces 
you to express the problem in your own words and often means that you solve the problem yourself before you stop 
talking. It's creating that expression that does the work, not the other person. That's why you can use a rubber 
duck or any person substitute.

12 minutes to here 

Taking normal notes, effectively something like dictation, it's perfectly possible to write down everything someone says 
and not to have understood a word. When you sketchnote, you are using active listening skills and forcing yourself 
to externalise what you are hearing, coming up with, on the fly, your own interpretation. 

It's a more deliberate & slower way of taking notes that encourages better listening, improving your understanding, your recall and 
making you more able to communicate the information you consume. It forces you to make sense in your mind of what you hear, find a way to represent 
it on the page in a way that makes sense to you.

Senses designed to work together - so when combined in a learning environment,
images and text say, the brain pays more attention and encodes the memory more robustly.

it's no surprise our brains are visually driven. In terms of Evolution, threats to our survival came to us first visually in the 
shape of a rapidly approaching tiger rather than a hand-written invitation - the tiger who came to tea. 

Words are only postage stamps delivering the object for you to unwrap - george bernard shaw

Interestingly, smell seems to play the biggest part in memory making and recall. Im not sure if a talk on Smell notes
would have got an audience!

# DDD North 2014

I was at DDD North for the first time in 2014 in Leeds.  It was the first time I had done live sketchnoting. I did 
three sketchnotes from three talks, Eve Barabas, Joel Hammond-Turner and Richard Dalton. I can still remember 
what those talks were about without referring to my notes just because of the sketchnoting process. It seems that once you 
have done the sketchnote you can destroy it or never look at it again and you will still retain some of the benefit. 
I did go to one other talk that day and didn't sketchnote it. I couldn't tell you who delivered it or what it was about.

#Fun

It's a fun thing to do and by sharing the sketchnotes on social media you can get great feedback from the 
community, speakers really love that you have taken the time to engage so deeply with their talk, and often you can continue 
discussions around the talks with other delegates far beyond the lifetime of the conference.

#Community 
				
There's a great community. Mike Rohde makes himself available on social media and is very supportive, the community in general 
is great, there is a weekly google hangout organized to talk about the minutiate of improving your craft if you are 
interested and there is a dedicated site: Sketchnote Army, that posts new sketchnoters all the time. 

#Why Not?

And why not? Short term factual recall - recording complete notes (meeting minutes etc) where factual correctness 
is more important than long term recall, normal typed or handwritten notes are better for these. 


# 4 - My Equipment

Let's talk quickly about my equipment. I am totally analogue in my approach. I carry a sketchbook with me 
everywhere, the brand isn't important - I choose them based on how thick the paper is so it doesn't let 
the ink bleed through the page so you can write on both sides.
 
Pic of pens and book

I can get by with the pen in the middle which is a good general purpose one but I also have a thicker 
pen for filling in large areas of black more easily. I have an orange-red for highlighting and a light 
grey for adding shadows. There's also a *Secret is in this picture* - ask about it later

I always use plain paper but if you aren't as confident in laying out your work, grid paper works fine too.

Lots of people like to use digital devices. For me it's personal choice whether to use iPad, tablet or paper and pen. 
It should be something where the interface doesn't stop you getting the work done. I see it a bit like the 
debate over vim vs emacs or eclipse vs visual studio. Use what's natural and fastest for you. Do what works 
for you to the point where the tool disappears - it should not be in the way.

<!-- Identify obstacles and explain how to overcome them. -->

Let's talk about a frequent objection to sketchnoting. Anyone want to guess what it might be?

# 5 - But I can't Draw

Pic of retro advert...

This is a frequent objection to starting to draw anything.

Now ever since I had my talk accepted by DDD I've been monitoring some of you in this room and 
yes, you're quite right, you can't draw.

Well, you can't draw like MichaelAngelo with God and Adam reaching out to touch each other's 
fingers. It took him almost 40 years to finish the Sistine chapel. I hope no talk you ever attend 
has to last that long.

If you google sketchnotes you will see some posted by professional illustrators that are super pretty.
I often see Mike Rohde (the pro designer) and think I want to give up.

So maybe we can't draw like Michael Angelo and we can't draw like Mike Rohde.

But maybe you could compare against a rubbish artist like Pablo Picasso.

Owl,
Bull,
Dog

It's really just lines and curves and circles and stuff put together, isn't it?

Maybe you could compare yourself against Dave Gray, noted Visual Thinker and inspiration for Mike Rohde's work.

./images/dave-gray-mann-gruber.webp

How about some cartoonists who work for a national newspaper? I've chosen the guardian in this case:

Tom Gauld - simple figures - convey meaning in posture and outline more than in faces or hands, feet. Pictures, 
icons and text are very sketchnote like, one of my favourite illustrators and had a big impact on how I try 
to draw figures.
./images/tom-gauld-sketchbook-1.webp

Josie Long - her series of cartoons on how she would change the world, very simple figures, faces, text.
./images/josie-long-another-planet.webp

Modern toss

Modern toss are super sweary but get their ideas across very quickly with very simple, scrappy pictures, very 
few lines and few words.

Finally, everyone's favourite web comic, xkcd by Randall Monroe, again stick figures and text.

As rubbish artist Pablo Picasso says:

Painting is a blind man's profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, 
what he tells himself about what he has seen. - Picasso.

Clearly these examples show that:

It's about
communication
not art
				
Jeannel King a graphic recorder has written an ebook you can get online around this whole topic 
- how to draw things that are "good enough", and communicate enough about your intent in low stress easy to follow way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6 - Basics

So the primary elements of any drawing are these:

dot, line, arrow, circle, square, triangle

If you can write your own name and make these marks with a burnt stick you can sketchnote.
<!-- If you can't do any of these come talk to me later -->

# Composition

We use composition to use build more shapes from these primitives. No inheritance is involved.

All we do is put these shapes together to build other shapes.									

Picasso pic - built from simple lines			
	
Icons
Label box with shadow
Clouds - Investigate?
Splat with Exclamation - challenge
Sequence Number in circle
Quotations
Flags

# Visual Alphabet

You use the shapes to build symbols that actually represent something from the talk in your sketchnote.

 # Bullets for lists
 
 # Speech Bubbles
 
 quotes or to simuate conversations.
 
 # Arrows
 
connect to link, big arrows for emphasis
 
 # Dividers
 
 separate - dotted lines, 
 
# People
 
Stick Figures - posture
Star people
Dave Gray people


#Emotions

Austin Kleon faces in boxes, strangley most of my figures show emotion through posture (I don't make them big 
enough to make emotions worthwhile). I often add faces to inanimate objects to show working or broken status.

# Text and Typography

Sean Wes examples

A big part of sketchnoting is making your writing look better than normal (if you're anything like me). 
Bad handwriting? writing block capitals will slow you down and improve your handwriting with practice
Write like you are drawing, create each letter as it's own set of curves and lines.  more appreciation 
for typography.

It's good to practice several types of well type - 

block capitals, 
double caps,
lower case, 
script (occasionally), 
3d when you get more ambitious.
outline or boxed

Headings

# Type Errors 

I am really bad at writing block Y's and A's. They are never symmetrical and I always slightly dread doing them. Here's 
a tip to correct type errors. Use double lines or fill in parts of a character to even up type, correct kerning, even 
out letter height and sometimes correct spelling. 

# Hierarchy

Create a hierarchy using size and separation, boldness, framing - bigger things are more important. 
Things in boxes or with more emphasis are more important. Think web H1..h6

# Colour

Several opinions on colour. I think it works best in small doses to add emphasis, usually when i use too much colour 
is when things start to get out of hand and it starts to look like a clown's nightmare.

# Structures

There are several common layouts - straight, columns, top down is easy, modular, meander, spider web (radial) , jazz

examples of layouts


# Secret Weapon

If you aren't confident about judging where parts of your composition should go or not very 
good at spacing stuff out, get yourself a blue pencil (as seen in the photo) - it gives you 
just enough help to see what you are doing but doesn't show up well against black ink and doesn't show 
up very well on photographs. I got that tip from a web-comic artist who uses a blue pencil all the time 
to mock out where figures are going to be. When the final art work is scanned, the blue is so feint 
it doesn't show up - particularly in b&W

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So let's talk about how to get started sketchnoting a presentation like the ones 
we will be seeing today...

REFACTOR ------------------------------------------------


# 7 - Hello, World

So you're going to SN a talk, here's how to get started.

First, select your talk. 

Fill in the title and the speakers name or twitter handle and your off to a good start.

Listen to the first few remarks - often they will give you an outline of what they will talk about
so you can judge what kind of layout you should use - is this 
10 things I hate about..., is it a meandering recollection of past events...?
Grids, tables - the 5 things I know about GitHub
Big Idea with lots of bits around the outside (mindmap like)
Journey/stories/steps 1...2..3.

10 things I hate about javascript might give you an idea to use two rows of 5 columns, one
box for each of the 10 things.

Remember that this is a plan and if it doesn't match the reality of the talk, that's ok.

# Use you active listening

Listen to what the speaker is saying, not what you think they are saying and without judgement. Ego. Listening gets better the more you 
practice it. Listening means you are thinking more about the subject and more likely to have questions at the end. 

Follow the speaker, their body language, voice - not the slides - they are available online after talk,
listen for when they are excited, sweary, quiet.

Don't boil the ocean, don't try to put down too much - don't be tempted into the old 
ways of taking dictation.

Capture what stands out to you.

Skip bits that don't interest you

Jokes, quotes f-bombs - high emotion or excitement, dramatic pauses, 
metaphors and similies	
				
Quotes - turn them into features, things to lookup later, book references, unanswered questions

# Be aware of hierarchy

Use basic shapes - bullets - lines and arrows, boxes and clouds to establish a visual hierarchy and give the correct level 
of importance to everything in your note.

At it's most basic, it's writing and using boxes and lines 
to establish a visual hierarchy - what's important and what's less important.	 

Whitespace is good.

# Listen for metaphors and similies

Often speakers will suggest a visual to you with their language but also be open to the possiblitiy of possible misunderstanding. 
Often taking what the speaker says literally or intentionally misunderstanding can lead to ideas for visuals that make the 
original idea more entertaining to you and therefore more likely to form a strong association in your memory.


# Technical talks

Don't capture code.

Listen for advice, libraries, products, fine just to watch code demo.

Tom Stuart, richard dalton


# Rule of thumb
 
Listen for things that mean something to you.
 
If you only had 10 tweets to describe this talk, what would you use 
them to tweet about ? 


# Use your Cache

If the speaker is listing important things too quickly, try writing just the first word or part of a word for each item 
then come back and fill in when you have a chance.

# Quiet times...

In quiet time, lulls in the talk or when rambling stories are happening, go back and draw associations and fill in details'
boxes and arrows to give emphasis - hiearchy, or just to catch up with your backlog.


# Keep in mind how you learn

Do you prefer more words and fewer pictures or more pictures with just a few key words sprinkled about? 


# Last

add decoration last - 

20 minutes here to the end...

# 8 - Create your own DSL

In the heat of sketchnoting a live event, you often can't spend ten minutes trying to think of the best way to draw a metaphor.
What will develop are a set of repeating icons that you will use over and over again to act as markers in your notes.

E.g. 
Ideas could be Lightbulbs

exclamation mark could be Something you disagree with or controversial
a surprising fact or idea could be a star or bang. 
Book for reference to look up
Cloud for something to investigate?

Over time you'll become more comfortable with these icons and fluent in drawing them. They become your "Visual Language" 
as sketchoting DSL if you will, a programming language for your brain. They really are there to communicate with you personally so it's fine if they don't 
match someone else's personal "language" but used consistently the context will communicate with others.

Anyone reading the abstract for this talk will have noticed I mentioned in it that sketchnoting was better than F#. This 
was mostly a troll for Richard Dalton who is giving a talk on F# somewhere else in the building at the moment. But it really 
is true. This hand-written DSL you are developing does not involve a keyboard - therefore it's "untyped" and it is really 
only required to parse or compile on a single virtual machine - your brain. (works on my machine).


# Inspiration

If you feel a bit lost for inspiration, there are no shortage on social media,
so find some styles you like and steal icons and techniques you like, it won't be long 
before you make them your own. 

Sketchnote army
The noun project

# Embrace your mistakes

Don't worry about spelling or drawing mistakes. You can come back and fill in letters, draw over 
bits that are wrong and mostly no one will notice in the finished note. If you make a mess, just 
accept it and move on - worrying about what you have done wrong will stop you capturing anything 
else the speaker has to say.

You can use patterns or fold the error into another design at the end. The other alternative is 
to repeat them - the first rule of acting improv. is to repeat the mistake and make it look like 
you intended it.

Examples of mistakes


# 9 - Review

Towards the end of the talk, check whether you have captured the right things. 

Are the main points visible, do they stand out? If not maybe make them more visible with spot colours, 
boxes or banners

Can you do anything else to enhance the hierarchy and connect ideas together 
that were not obvious at the time.

Quotes? Put in speech bubbles or quotation marks.

Is the flow of the talk clear? use numbers to indicate non-obvious flows.

If you want, use colour to draw attention to things - don't use everywhere

# Unit Test

Good to test our code. Test of a good sketchnote is that you can reconstruct the highlights
of the talk from your SN, to be able to recall the most important parts for you.
what are you going to remember and how are you going to remember?
		
If you can do this, you get a green. 

#Refactoring:	
	
Opportunity to refactor if you come up red. Use it 
as a learning tool for next time - Text is meaningless? Picture doesn't mean anything?

Practice improves
Confreaks, youtube - no pressure way to practice - press pause

#Checking in

Share

After talk is done, photograph it and post to twitter, Flickr, PInterest.
Tweet presenter and use event hashtag. Shows you've paid attention and engaged. 
It's a good way to show appreciation for the speaker (and they love it)
and it can expand on and keep the conversation going after the talk, perhaps extending your 
knowledge or understanding further.

Had a lot of positive feedback from this (see more later).				

You can tidy up and scan them in if you feel like it. I do for my blog but I tend to do it 
infrequently and in batches rather than when I do them.

My live sn was at ddd north 14 and had some lovely conversations with the presenters after the conference was over

Corey Lattislaw - in the past she used to photograph her sketchnotes at the end like everyone else but recently 
she qualifies for the award for most high-tech solution, she uses an old pair of Google Glasses to 
record her sketchnotes live and then share the still images and short vine-like videos on G+.
 
# 10 - Using 

Is it just for personal recording of conferences, talks, meetings? There are other uses this 
was just one example to get you started.

In Education, Julie Stitt and Derek Bruff are exploring using VN in class rooms and are seeing 
improvements in pupil outcomes for understanding, recall and engagement.

Vanessa Ralph - has a Kickstarter to sketchote a Chemistry textbook (image)

Austin Kleon keeps a daily journal of his todo lists and what he achieved during the day. He (and lots of 
others) seem to like to do Book summaries in sketchnote form.

For the agile folk amongst us:

Laurens Bonnema, agile coach - uses SNs to facilitate some of the Scrum Process - in sprint planning, 
during retrospectives and reviews. 
If anyone is interested in this, Laurens runs a course for Product Owners and there are details in the SNW.

I talked about Atlassian at the start - building shared understanding

Veronica Erb - uses SNs in her UX work and to help engagement with her clients

# Personal Study

For example I wanted to better understand some lean concepts so I did one for Muda, Mura, Muri
Dreyfuss Model, talk from Kanban Dan Brown about flow in lean systems.

One for fun - Movie scene - Alec Baldwin from Glengary Glenross
	
# 11 - My Contribution - In Reverse
	
Had to do a talk which included a fair bit of live coding and was pointless having a powerpoint I was 
constantly switching to and from. Hate live coding but couldn't get out of it, didn't have much time to 
rehearse a seamless presentation and also find I get lost really easily when trying to follow written notes. 
I end up having to read them and it's a bit horrific. I still needed a narrative flow through the ideas. 
So I decided to test the claim that the memory thing would work and I created sketchnote of what I imaginged 
someone who was watching me would make. I then used this as my guide for the talk - it was easy to keep 
track of where I was in the flow without having to keep reading word for word.

And so was born the idea of Sketchnoting in Reverse. I blogged and tweeted about it and that was it.
The presentation worked beautifully and I had a lot of good feedback from it. I have since used it a few 
more times for other talks and sometimes to help me plan a talk.

# 12 - Warning - Vanity Slides Ahead

# Infamy infamy they've all got it infamy
	 	
# Some Cool things that have happened to me this year...

I've been doing SN for about 2 years and I thought I would share with you a couple of cool 
projects I've been involved with as a result.
				
1. I did a SN of the first meeting of FooCafe, where Dan North talked about deliberate practice.
The organizer of Foo Cafe, Michael Tiberg (of oredev fame) contacted me and asked for a high-res version of the 
picture I posted on twitter. They are going to use it for A1 size promotional posters for FooCafe around university 
campuses, co-working spaces etc. in Sweden.

They are being printed about now so I don't have one yet but I'm looking forward to 
getting a picture of one in situ.
					
2. Agile consultant Paul Klipp hired me to do a SN for the 2015 ACE conference he organizes in 
Poland. I drew the short straw to do Tom Gilb's talk, not because there was anything wrong with it 
but it was very fact and statistics heavy and took a lot of absorption and processing to come up with a workable 
representation. This is one example where I definitely had to have more than one go at it to get 
something I was comfortable with. Paul has made the procedings available for donations on leanpub 

3. In 2014 Mike Rohde came up with the sequel to the SNH, and called it the SNW and filled it with all 
the people were using the techniques he had taught in interesting and unusual ways. Most of it is 
rubbish but there is one page - page 55 - that is really brilliant.

#Try

Try sketchnoting some of the sessions you are in today. I have the word of the organizer that 
nobody will kill you for trying. 

Post a picture of the sketchnote to twitter using #dddnorth 
(or come and show me so I can tweet it)

----
				
#Catch

At the end of the day when we have prize giving, I will pick a winner at semi-random and 
they will win a copy of Mike Rohde's new book the SNW. 

----

#Finally
