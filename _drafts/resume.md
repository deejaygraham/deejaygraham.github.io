principles

 We follow these principles:

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly. 


manifesto

 We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.



Provide technical guidance in software design and development activities.

Assist in maintenances and upgrades of existing software applications.

Participate in design reviews and recommend improvements.

Provide support in all phases of SDLC and ensure to deliver high-quality products.

Provide trainings and mentor other Engineers when required.

Analyze and troubleshoot application issues in a timely fashion.

Develop most effective technical solutions to meet business requirements.

Work with other Engineers in planning, prioritizing and executing assigned tasks within deadlines.

Assist in risk assessment and mitigation activities.

Attend team meetings to communicate project status and discuss about new ideas and any issues.

Recommend new technologies to ensure quality and productivity.

Assist in technical audits and make sure to implement audit recommendations.

Make business presentations to management when needed.

Work with QA team in preparing test cases, plans and procedures.

##### May 2008 - Present
## Professional Experience
### Senior Developer
#### BP&R MMD, Sage (UK)

I currently work in the R&D department, mainly working on the Financials and
Commercials  modules  of  Sage  200.  For  the  last  few  months,  I  have  taken
responsibility for several tasks 

##### May 2005 - May 2008
### Principal Developer
#### Bede Scientific Instruments Plc

I lead the Automation Software team at Bede for 3 years, developing software for
300mm  x-ray  metrology  equipment  for  the  semiconductor  manufacturing
industry.  Reporting  to  the  VP  of  Technology,  I  was  responsible  for  the
development of the software team, goal-setting and organization of work. I was
also  responsible  for  performance  reviews  and  hiring  personnel  as  well  as
mentoring and coaching the team to develop personal capabilities. 

The team worked in a mixed environment of C++, VB6, SQL Server, C#.NET and
Delphi, maintaining large legacy systems for existing customers and developing
new systems to address new markets and products. Systems needed to be reliable
24-7,  running  in  a  completely  automated  “lights-out”  factory  environment
without  the  need  for  human  intervention.  I  introduced  agile  development
practices to the department to improve reliability and confidence in the systems,
allowing defects to be fixed and new features to be added in a shorter timer. The
team  used  these  techniques  to  increase  automated  test  coverage,  reduced
software build times and reduced installation complexity. 

##### Mar 2003 - May 2005
### Principal Developer
#### ActivAeon Ltd, Sunderland

I was responsible for leading a team developing the company’s flagship product,
working in partnership with Microsoft’s volume licensing division, and producing
the first three shipping versions. I was responsible for the technical success and
integrity of the solution and for directing and reviewing the work of the team.
The system was developed as a client server architecture using C++ and C#, XML
and SQL Server, deployed on multiple Windows targets (2000, XP and various
flavours of Windows terminal servers) . I was involved in hands-on development
as well as mentoring and coaching less experienced team members. I introduced 
agile techniques and practices, such as continuous integration and automated
unit testing, to improve system reliability and reduce delivery times.

##### Dec 2001 - Mar 2003
### Technical Consultant
#### Agility Systems Ltd, Darlington

I was responsible for the specification, analysis and design of applications using
Visual C++ and Visual Basic for Windows 2000, Windows CE mobile devices and
dedicated barcode scanning devices. Project managing a number of concurrent
projects  in  differing  stages  of  development,  I  delivered  business  critical  ERP
solutions to customers throughout UK and Europe. Customers included Coloplast
A/S, Johnson-Matthey, JCB, Vodafone and Coca-Cola.
