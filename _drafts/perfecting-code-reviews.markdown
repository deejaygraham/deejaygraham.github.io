I first read about the Core Protocols way back in the early 2000s from <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/">Jim & Michele
McCarthy</a>'s book "Software for your head".

It seemed like a nice idea and we tried adopting the protocols with a team I was working
with a little bit later but due to other constraints it didn't entirely succeed.

Like all great ideas, it came back to me again while listening to the <a href="http://integrumtech.com/category/agile-weekly-podcast/">agile
weekly</a> podcast in the early 2010's. I had not had another opportunity to try using them until
recently when talking to a friend about code reviews.

What I noticed during the conversation was that I had subconsciously been using the *Perfection Game*
in recent code reviews sessions. It was in an adapted form to suit the medium but still
captured the spirit of the original.

### Perfection

The Perfection Game is used to help you improve something you have created. It's a time when
you are asking for help in making something better so that the exercise becomes more
collaborative than critical.

It starts with the creator (or *perfectee*) presenting something to someone else, asking that
person to rate the performance on a scale of 1 to 10. The *perfector* then lists the things
they liked about the performance and offers suggestions for improvement that would take the work
form it's current score to a "10".

### Review

Code reviews, by contrast, can be very negative experiences, particularly for less experienced
developers presenting code to world weary, battle scarred bad-ass senior devs. A more experienced
developer looking at the code may be tempted to start straight into statements pretending to be
questions - "why did you do it that way?", "that's all wrong, why would you write it like that?",
"why didn't you think about...?", "how can that ever work?" etc.

The junior dev may strongly identify with *their* code and feel very protective of it, maybe even
insulted if the code doesn't see them instantly welcomed as the second coming of Linus Torvalds. There's probably
a whole series of articles on using techniques like the Socratic method to teach self evaluation
of source code.

Teaching a
less experienced hey
may also shut down


In this case, I
was also using it, covertly, with

### Steps

Here's how I tend to approach code reviews now using my covert perfection game :)




### Conclusion

It seems to be working well and I *think* I might keep it.
