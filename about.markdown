## Hello.

My name is Derek Graham and this is my personal weblog. I'm a software 
developer working in the North East of England for a very popular business 
software company. I can't be sure that the opinions expressed here are my own
so they definitely don't represent the views of my employer.

My main areas of interest are in using agile methods to help improve what 
we ship, test-driven development, continuous learning, visual thinking, 
design and, of course, code.

<small>The information in the weblog, or blog, is provided "AS IS" with no warranties
epressed or implied. Code may not compile if you do not keep up payments on it.
No classes were harmed in the making of this blog.</small>
