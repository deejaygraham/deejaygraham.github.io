## Hey, Hi, Hello.

My name is Derek Graham and this is my personal blog. 

I'm a Principal Software Developer working for a very popular business 
software company in the North East of England. 

I can't be sure that the opinions expressed here are my own so they definitely 
don't represent the views of my employer.

My main areas of interest are in using **agile methods** to help improve what 
we **ship**, **test-driven** development, unit **testing**, continuous and 
deliberate **learning**, **visual** thinking, design and, of course, **code**.

<small>The information in the weblog, or blog, is provided "AS IS" with no warranties
epressed or implied. Code may not compile if you do not keep up payments on it.
No classes were harmed in the making of this blog.</small>
