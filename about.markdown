## Hello.

My name is Derek Graham and this is my personal website. I'm a software 
developer working in the North East of England for a very popular business 
software company.

My main areas of interest are in using agile methods to help improve what 
we ship, test-driven development, continuous learning, visual thinking, 
design and, of course, code.
