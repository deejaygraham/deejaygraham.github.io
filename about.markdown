## Hey, Hi, Hello.

My name is Derek Graham and this is my personal blog. 

I'm a Principal Software Developer working for a very popular business 
software company in the North East of England. 

I can't be sure that the opinions expressed here are my own so they definitely 
don't represent the views of my employer.

My main areas of interest are in using **agile methods** to help improve what 
we **ship**, **test-driven** development, unit **testing**, continuous and 
deliberate **learning**, **visual** thinking, design and, of course, **code**.

### A Note on Sharing

I've had a few requests from people wanting to use sketchnotes or graphics from my 
site for non-commercial uses. I try to make sure all posts that contain any "art" 
work are marked with a creative commons licence:

{% include licence-boilerplate.html %}

If you follow the link to creative commons, there is a section that describes what 
you can and cannot use the material for. In short:

* Don't use it to make money
* Credit me for the work
* Build upon it, if you like 
* Share it

Not part of the licence but I'd also really like it if you would let me know, 
by email or tweet, what you did with it or how it helped you.

epressed or implied. Code may not compile if you do not keep up payments on it or 
fall into technical debt. No classes were harmed in the making of this blog.</small>
