<h2 class="is-size-2">Hey, Hi, Hello.</h2>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">My name is Derek Graham and this is my personal blog.</p>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">I'm a Principal Software Developer working for a very popular business
software company in the North East of England. I can't be sure that the opinions 
I have expressed here are my own so they **definitely** don't represent the views 
of my employer.</p>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">I co-organize <a href="http://nebytes.net" target="_blank">NE Bytes</a>, a monthly .Net community get-together and 
<a href="http://meetup.com/Agile-North-East/">Agile North East</a>, both hosted in Newcastle city centre.</p>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">I am an <strong>Extreme Programmer</strong>, an Infrequent <strong>Sketchnoter</strong>, a Collector 
of <strong>Programming</strong> Languages, a <strong>Speaker</strong>, a <strong>Mob</strong> Programmer, a <strong>Test-Driven</strong> 
Developer and Struggling <strong>Agilista</strong>. I am also a 
STEM ambassador, microbit hacker and project lead for the "Makers & Creators" events at Campus North with Tech for Life UK.</p>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">My main areas of interest are in using <strong>agile methods</strong> to help improve what
we <strong>ship</strong>, <strong>test-driven</strong> development, unit <strong>testing</strong>, continuous and
deliberate <strong>learning</strong>, <strong>visual</strong> thinking, design and, of course, <strong>code</strong>.</p>


<h2 class="is-size-2">A Note on Sharing</h2>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">I've had a few requests from people wanting to use sketchnotes or graphics from my
site for non-commercial uses. I try to make sure all posts that contain any "art"
work are marked with a creative commons licence:</p>

{% include licence-boilerplate.html %}

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">If you follow the link to creative commons, there is a section that describes what
you can and cannot use the material for. In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't use it to make money</li>
<li>Credit me for the work</li>
<li>Build upon it, if you like</li>
<li>Share it</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">Not part of the licence but I'd also really like it if you would let me know,
by email or tweet, what you did with it or how it helped you.</p>

<h2 class="is-size-2">Other Illustrations</h2>

<p class="has-vertical-spacing">You will notice some of the "hero" images on some posts are not drawn by me. They
are from [Old Book Illustrations](http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/), a searchable
site of public domain illustrations.</a>
