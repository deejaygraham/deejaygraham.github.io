# Hello.

My name is Derek Graham and this is my personal website. I'm a software developer working in the North East 
of England for a very popular business software company.

My main areas of interest are in using agile methods to help improve what we ship, test-driven development, 
continuous learning, visual thinking, design and, of course, code.
