# deejaygraham.github.io

This is my Github user page that used to be made with Jekyll. It is now made using 11ty. If this page gets published at http://deejaygraham.github.io something has gone badly wrong.

## Validation

The markdown and javascript used in the site for building or at runtime are validated with several lint tools before building. 

## Build 

The site is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and published here in glorious github.

## Test

Tests are split into two areas. Plain javascript - 11ty filters etc - is tested using the [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner. End to end tests are 
done by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) and are run on every push to main. One test is excluded - testing the clipboard copy - because I can't get it to 
work correctly in CI, it is available to run on a local build. The [cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests have now been retired but are still available in the 
source.
