## Professional Experience
### Senior Developer
#### BP&R MMD, Sage (UK)
##### May 2008 - Present

I currently work in the R&D department, mainly working on the Financials and
Commercials  modules  of  Sage  200.  For  the  last  few  months,  I  have  taken
responsibility for several tasks 

### Principal Developer
#### Bede Scientific Instruments Plc
##### May 2005 - May 2008

I lead the Automation Software team at Bede for 3 years, developing software for
300mm  x-ray  metrology  equipment  for  the  semiconductor  manufacturing
industry.  Reporting  to  the  VP  of  Technology,  I  was  responsible  for  the
development of the software team, goal-setting and organization of work. I was
also  responsible  for  performance  reviews  and  hiring  personnel  as  well  as
mentoring and coaching the team to develop personal capabilities. 

The team worked in a mixed environment of C++, VB6, SQL Server, C#.NET and
Delphi, maintaining large legacy systems for existing customers and developing
new systems to address new markets and products. Systems needed to be reliable
24-7,  running  in  a  completely  automated  “lights-out”  factory  environment
without  the  need  for  human  intervention.  I  introduced  agile  development
practices to the department to improve reliability and confidence in the systems,
allowing defects to be fixed and new features to be added in a shorter timer. The
team  used  these  techniques  to  increase  automated  test  coverage,  reduced
software build times and reduced installation complexity. 

### Principal Developer
#### ActivAeon Ltd, Sunderland
##### Mar 2003 - May 2005

I was responsible for leading a team developing the company’s flagship product,
working in partnership with Microsoft’s volume licensing division, and producing
the first three shipping versions. I was responsible for the technical success and
integrity of the solution and for directing and reviewing the work of the team.
The system was developed as a client server architecture using C++ and C#, XML
and SQL Server, deployed on multiple Windows targets (2000, XP and various
flavours of Windows terminal servers) . I was involved in hands-on development
as well as mentoring and coaching less experienced team members. I introduced 
agile techniques and practices, such as continuous integration and automated
unit testing, to improve system reliability and reduce delivery times.

### Technical Consultant
#### Agility Systems Ltd, Darlington
##### Dec 2001 - Mar 2003

I was responsible for the specification, analysis and design of applications using
Visual C++ and Visual Basic for Windows 2000, Windows CE mobile devices and
dedicated barcode scanning devices. Project managing a number of concurrent
projects  in  differing  stages  of  development,  I  delivered  business  critical  ERP
solutions to customers throughout UK and Europe. Customers included Coloplast
A/S, Johnson-Matthey, JCB, Vodafone and Coca-Cola.
