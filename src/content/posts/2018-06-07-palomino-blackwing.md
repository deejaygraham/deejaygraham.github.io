Ever on the look out for new sketchnoting supplies as I am, we found a <a href="http://www.oswells.co.uk/">new stationary shop</a>
had just opened in Barnard Castle. Inside, my wife found the legendary Palomino Blackwing pencil and bought one for me.

I had heard about the pencil before but was really surprised to find out that it makes a cameo appearance
opposite Richard Dreyfuss in an early scene from one of our favourite movies, Jaws.
