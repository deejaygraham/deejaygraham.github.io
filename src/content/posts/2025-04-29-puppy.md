I am learning slowly to bring my crazy pinball-machine mind back to this place of friendly detachment toward myself, 
so I can look out at the world and see all those other things with respect. Try looking at your mind as a wayward 
puppy that you are trying to paper train. You don’t drop-kick a puppy into the neighbor’s yard every time it 
piddles on the floor. You just keep bringing it back to the newspaper. So I keep trying gently to bring my mind 
back to what is really there to be seen, maybe to be seen and noted with a kind of reverence.
