Betty Snyder and I, from the beginning, were a pair. And I think... I don't know if any of you 
work technically but I believe that the best programs, the best design and all this stuff is done 
by pairs because you can criticize each other, find each otherâ€™s errors, and use the best ideas. It 
really works very well.
