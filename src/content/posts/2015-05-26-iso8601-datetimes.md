<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> date and time format is something I find the best 
format in logs and file names but can never keep the magic format string in my head. So, I wrote a couple of 
extension methods, one for standard and one for extended format.


```csharp

{% include 'code/csharp/ISO8601DateTimeTests.cs' %}

```


```csharp

{% include 'code/csharp/ISO8601DateTime.cs' %}

```
