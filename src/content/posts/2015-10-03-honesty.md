# Coniston's Honest Shop

With this whole sketchnote mularky, I've started to have more of an appreciation of typography 
and hand-written type. We were visiting Coniston recently and stopped into the Honest Shop. This is 
an unstaffed shop that relies on the customer's honesty to pay for anything they buy. I particularly 
liked the documentation provided which is written on the wall.

The shop door is also a lovely illustration of the signwriter's art.
