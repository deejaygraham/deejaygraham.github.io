I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read 
a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the 
least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third 
of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look 
so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a 
man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the 
top of the charts.

And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve 
ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.
