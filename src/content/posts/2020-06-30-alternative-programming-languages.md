An ancient relic I found while tidying up the other week. It's a CD-ROM from Dr Dobbs Journal, the best ever programming magazine,
from around 1995. It contained lost of new, experimental languages in the days before each language had it's own website.

The thing that strikes me most seeing it again after all these years is that languages today that we think of as mainstream,
Python, Pascal, Perl, Smalltalk, were all included as "alternative". Of course, there are others, including my favourite - Bob -
which have remained alternative but still have a following or active development on the 'net.
