Another from the department of uses-the-syntax-so-infrequentyly-I-nearly-always-forget.

This time, in conversation with a colleague, we were discussing the advantages 
and disadvantages between explicit inline javascript embedded in html tags 
and wiring up events in an external js file.

Embarrasingly, despite the amount of time I have spent working in jQuery and 
javascript I found I couldn't remember the exact syntax in plain old javascript.

So this is a message to my future self, who will forget again before too long :)
