Austin Kleon's method for making tiny zines from a single sheet of paper.

In this sketchnote I tried to incorporate a couple of elements from Austin's own work, 
the title is in the form of one of his blackout poems and the author sketch in the 
top right (and the correct in the middle) are little sketches stuck onto the main 
sketchnote, collage-like.
