I've started using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and wanted to collect together
and share a couple of keyboard shortcuts I have used when giving presentations with it.

## Full-Screen Mode

Press _F_ to go full screen and _Esc_ to cancel.

## Fade Out

To hide a slide temporarily use the _B_ or _._ (dot) key.

## Speaker View

Enabled by using _S_. Shows a timer and content of slides with &lt;aside&gt; markup.

## Fast Navigation

Show the slide overview using _Esc_.

## Zoom

Use the mouse to _Alt+Click_ to zoom in and out.
