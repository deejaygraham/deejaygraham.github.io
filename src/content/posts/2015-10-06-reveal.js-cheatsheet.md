I've started using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and wanted to collect together 
and share a couple of keyboard shortcuts I have used when giving presentations with it.

## Full-Screen Mode

Press *F* to go full screen and *Esc* to cancel.

## Fade Out

To hide a slide temporarily use the *B* or *.* (dot) key.

## Speaker View

Enabled by using *S*. Shows a timer and content of slides with &lt;aside&gt; markup.

## Fast Navigation

Show the slide overview using *Esc*. 

## Zoom

Use the mouse to *Alt+Click* to zoom in and out.
