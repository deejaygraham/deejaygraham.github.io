I have wanted to learn ruby in anger for a long time and have had many false starts.
I understand and appreciate the syntax and expressiveness but I'm not in a
position to use it regularly in my day job. Like so many other things, I
find if I don't use it enough it tends to leak away.

So I got [Chris Pine's](https://pine.fm/) book
[Learn to Program](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program-2nd-edition)
and started working through it.

To make the chapters "stick" in my memory, I am doing the exercises at the end
of each chapter and posting them on github [here](https://github.com/deejaygraham/LearnToProgram).
