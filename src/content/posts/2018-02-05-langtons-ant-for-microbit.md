Another example of cellular automata that I've only just discovered is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant">Langton's Ant</a>. 

It's a tiny program that obeys a couple of simple rules and draws some really very interesting patterns that look for all the world like 
there is an intelligence behind the process, guiding it.  

```python

{ % include code/python/microbit/langtons-ant.py %}

```

The effect is somewhat reduced on the microbit's 5x5 screen but it's still a nice illustration of complexity coming from simple rules.
