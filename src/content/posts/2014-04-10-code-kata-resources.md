I've been accumulating resources for code katas recently so I'm posting 
them here in the hope that I don't just forget them or lose them down the 
back of the sofa.

* [TDD Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/all-problems-1)
* [CyberDojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/) by [Jon Jagger](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/)
* [CodeKatas.Org](http://codekatas.org/) screencasts of developers performing a kata.
* [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/)
* [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) by the late Jim Weirich and [Joe O'Brien](http://twitter.com/objo)
* [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/) by [Emmanuel Gaillot](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?EmmanuelGaillot)
* [Software Craftsmanship Code Katas](http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
* [Kata Club](http://www.kataclub.com/) by [Nola Stowe](http://blog.rubygeek.com/)
* [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/) by [Dave Thomas](http://pragdave.me/)
* [MicroBlogging](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html) a nice 
multi-step project to interact with Twitter in Ruby. More of these kinds of tutorials are
available at [JumpstartLab's tutorials](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/).

Although there are a few in this list that have language specific solutions, 
most of them can be attempted in any language.

The last site in the list also has a very nice article about 
[Kata and the Dreyfuss Model of Skills Acquisition](http://codekata.com/kata/kata-kumite-koan-and-dreyfus/)
by Dave Thomas that is well worth reading.
