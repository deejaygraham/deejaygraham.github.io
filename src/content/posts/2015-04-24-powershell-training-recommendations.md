Microsoft Virtual Academy is a training resource I didn't know about until I had it recommended to me
by a work colleague.

I have wanted to learn PowerShell for a while and noticed that they have two beginner to intermediate
courses aimed at getting you quickly up to speed with basic PowerShell and progressing onto adapting
napkin sketches of code into reusable tools. Both of them feature [Jeffrey Snover](http://twitter.com/jsnover),
the inventor of PowerShell so are full of background to PowerShell's behaviour and why features were implemented
in a particular way. I found them both very useful and learned a lot from them.
