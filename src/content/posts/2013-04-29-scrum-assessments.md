Today I discovered the [Open Assessments](https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Open-Assessments) 
page at [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/), a free test of your understanding 
of scrum in the form of a set of timed multiple choice questions. 

I found you need to be careful when taking the assessments to read the questions 
fully and not to just jump at the first answer that springs to mind.

For anyone doubting I could even spell my name correctly, I managed to pass 
the Scrum Open assessment :)
