<p>We are discreet sheep; we wait to see how the drove is going, and then go with the drove. We have two opinions: one private, 
which we are afraid to express; and another one — the one we use — which we force ourselves to wear to please Mrs. Grundy, until 
habit makes us comfortable in it, and the custom of defending it presently makes us love it, adore it, and forget how pitifully 
we came by it.</p>

<p>Look at it in politics. Look at the candidates whom we loathe, one year, and are afraid to vote against, the next; whom we cover 
with unimaginable filth, one year, and fall down on the public platform and worship, the next — and keep on doing it until the 
habitual shutting of our eyes to last year’s evidences brings us presently to a sincere and stupid belief in this year’s.</p>

<p>Look at the tyranny of party — at what is called party allegiance, party loyalty — a snare invented by designing men for selfish 
purposes — and which turns voters into chattels, slaves, rabbits, and all the while their masters, and they themselves are shouting 
rubbish about liberty, independence, freedom of opinion, freedom of speech, honestly unconscious of the fantastic contradiction; and 
forgetting or ignoring that their fathers and the churches shouted the same blasphemies a generation earlier when they were closing 
their doors against the hunted slave, beating his handful of humane defenders with Bible texts and billies, and pocketing the insults 
and licking the shoes of his Southern master.</p>

<p>If we would learn what the human race really is at bottom, we need only observe it in election times.</p>

<p>A Hartford clergyman met me in the street and spoke of a new nominee — denounced the nomination, in strong, earnest words — words 
that were refreshing for their independence, their manliness. He said, “I ought to be proud, perhaps, for this nominee is a relative 
of mine; on the contrary, I am humiliated and disgusted, for I know him intimately — familiarly — and I know that he is an unscrupulous 
scoundrel, and always has been.” You should have seen this clergyman preside at a political meeting forty days later, and urge, and 
plead, and gush — and you should have heard him paint the character of this same nominee.</p>

<p>You would have supposed he was describing the Cid, and Greatheart, and Sir Galahad, and Bayard the Spotless all rolled into one. Was 
he sincere? Yes — by that time; and therein lies the pathos of it all, the hopelessness of it all. It shows at what trivial cost of effort a 
man can teach himself to lie, and learn to believe it, when he perceives, by the general drift, that that is the popular thing to do.</p>

<p>Does he believe his lie yet? Oh, probably not; he has no further use for it. It was but a passing incident; he spared to it the moment 
that was its due, then hastened back to the serious business of his life.</p>
