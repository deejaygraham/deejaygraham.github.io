I recently got hold of a copy of the [Sketchnote Ideabook](https://sketchnoteideabook.com) designed by Mike Rohde and produced by 
[Airship Notebooks](https://airship.store/products/sketchnote-ideabook) and I'm really impressed with the finish of the product, 
the cover is nice to hold and the paper is great for drawing on and nothing seems to bleed through from page to page even with a very 
heavy ink.
