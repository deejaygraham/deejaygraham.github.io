The <a href="http://sketchnotearmy.com">Sketchnote Army</a> website has been running a challenge to create a
sketchnote to capture a snippet of time from episode #219 of the <a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/">Mac
Power User's</a> podcast featuring <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">David Allen</a>.
