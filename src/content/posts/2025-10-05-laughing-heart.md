  your life is your life
  don't let it be clubbed into dank submission
  be on the watch
  there are ways out.
  there is a light somewhere
  it may not be much light but
  it beats the darkness.
  be on the watch.
  the gods will offer you chances.
  know them.
  take them.
  you can't beat death but
  you can beat death in life, sometimes.
  and the more often you learn to do it,
  the more light there will be.
  your life is your life.
  know it while you have it.
  you are marvelous
  the gods wait to delight
  in you.
