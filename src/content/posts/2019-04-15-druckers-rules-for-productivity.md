title: Druckers Rules for Productivity

I've been re-reading some of Peter Druckers work and particularly his paper
from the California Management Review <a href="http://agileconsortium.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/70970029/knowledge_workers_the_biggest_challenge.pdf">Knowledge-Worker
Productivity: The Biggest Challenge</a>.

Six major factors determine knowledge-worker productivity.

<ul>
<li>Knowledge-worker productivity demands that we ask the question: "What is the task?"</li>
<li>It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the individual 
knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge Workers have to manage themselves. They have to have autonomy.</li>
<li>Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and the responsibility of knowledge workers.</li>
<li>Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching 
on the part of the knowledge worker.</li>
<li>Productivity of the knowledge worker is not—at least not primarily—a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.</li>
<li>Finally, knowledge-worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an "asset" rather than a "cost." 
It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.</li>
</ul>

Each of these requirements (except perhaps the last one) is almost the exact opposite of what is needed to increase
the productivity of the manual worker.
