Ordinarily, the way sketchnotes work is that you are capturing and distilling ideas
and information from a talk or similar event and presenting them on paper. Twice recently that  
process got turned on its head or inside out or something and the sketchnotes became the
topic of conversation.

First, I stumbled on a video of a talk by Geoff Bowden at the 2015 Agile Yorkshire
Christmas lightning talks meeting, titled ["Sketchnoting Agile One Doodle at A Time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZTkP6Joqro), in
which Geoff credits seeing my talk at [DDD North](http://dddnorth.co.uk/) in
October 2015. I had no idea that I was going to be mentioned and it was a little surreal
hearing my own name but still, super cool!

Next, I sketchnoted a slightly [controversial talk](https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/why-every-element-of-solid-is-wrong) by [Dan North](https://twitter.com/tastapod)
about how lots of the [SOLID guidelines](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)>) are redundant, wrong or just overly complicated.

This got a huge (for me) storm of feedback about how it was completely wrong, we didn't
understand any of it etc. etc. One nice interaction was from [Eduardo Ferro Aldama](https://twitter.com/eferro) who asked if he could use the sketchnote to illustrate a
point in his upcoming talk at the [Barcelona Software Craftsmanship](https://scbcn.github.io/) conference.

Once the conference was finished he was kind enough to point me to
his [blog post](http://www.eferro.net/2017/10/simplicidad-para-desarrolladores.html) and
the video [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1013&v=6FDxbCzh2sI).
