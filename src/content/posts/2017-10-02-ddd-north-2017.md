I am speaking at the <a href="http://dddnorth.co.uk/">DDD North 2017</a> developer conference 
on the 14th of October at the University of Bradford. My session is called "Married to the Mob (programming)" 
and is on adopting the practice of, unsurprisingly, mob programming for software development.
