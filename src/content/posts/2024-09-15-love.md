Love isn't a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like struggle.

To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way he or she is, right 
here and now. When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows 
that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch.

That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot 
survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice 
that proves more powerful than greed.
