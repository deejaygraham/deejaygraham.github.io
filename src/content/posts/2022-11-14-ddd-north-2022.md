Once again I am hugely honoured to have been picked to talk at the <a href="http://dddnorth.co.uk/">DDD North 2022</a>
developer conference on the 3rd of December at the University of Hull. My session is called "How to be Psychic"
and is about evolutionary design, refactoring and testing.

## Update

The talk went very well and I got some good questions at the end. I saw that a couple of people had written some reviews about it: 
[Rob Miles](https://www.robmiles.com/journal/2022/12/3/ddd-north-in-hull-was-completely-wonderful) and [Craig Pickles](https://www.yorkshiretechy.co.uk/blogs/a-day-at-dddnorth-developers-conference-in-hull-nov2022/)
