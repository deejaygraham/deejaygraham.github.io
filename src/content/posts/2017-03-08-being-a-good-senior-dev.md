I saw a tweet last year from <a href="http://twitter.com/rgladwell">Ricardo Gladwell</a>
around what it means to be a senior dev. This stuck with me as good, concise guidance
to pass onto junior team members but since twitter isn't very portable to IRL, I had
an analog version of it to remind me. It kept lodged in the back of my head so I
thought I would make something out of it.
