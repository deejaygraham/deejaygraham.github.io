More on teaching scratch to beginners, I usually start off with building this game in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>.

It shows off all the important capabilities of the platform in a digestable form. The cast moves around the screen and tries to "catch" 
the player's mouse pointer (because puns), scores a point for each time it does, and the game ends when you reach a particular score.

The game, as it is built up in stages, demonstrates:

* Moving across the screen in terms of x and y
* Moving by different amounts
* Using a variable to represent the amount of movement
* Forever loops
* What to do at the edge of the screen
* Turning the sprite around
* Animating movement using costumes
* Moving towards another location without maths
* Touching logic and branching
* Global variables for score and win
* Stopping the game
