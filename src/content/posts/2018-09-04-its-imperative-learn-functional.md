Erland 250 years of development into making it rock solid OS.

Elixir sounds exotic but it borrows from languages (and others have borrowed from it) so that
it doesn't seem too scary.

Coding dojo - find a nice language that nobody knows anything about.

Hard to understand - not c like syntax - like C# or java

Parallel processing

Hard multitasking is easy
No cooperative multiataksing like in old windows - crashes if someone forgets to play by the rules

Documentation
Execution speed
FUnction overloading
parameter values not number of variables

Pipeliniong like in unix or powershell

Pattern matching

client and server code communication

Json,

ORM, Query is weird but not difficult

Distribution package manager

.Net
