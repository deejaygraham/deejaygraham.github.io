We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten 
thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely 
right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has 
to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to 
exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true 
business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it is they were thinking about before somebody 
came along and told them they had to earn a living.
