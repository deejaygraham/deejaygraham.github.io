title: Microbit Haiku Generator
tags: [microbit, python]
---

Continuing the theme of "random" text generation, a good candidate is the pseudo-haiku. There are many different ways of generating a haiku but many of them 
not necessarily the most authentic or in the spirit of the art form. Here I am taking the least effortful approach. I used MS Copilot to generate lists of 
common five and seven syllable phrases to act as a source text from which to generate the haiku sticking to the 5-7-5 syllable formula.


## Code

### haiku.py

```python
from microbit import *
import random

class Haiku:

    def __init__(self, five_syllable_words, seven_syllable_words):
        self.line1 = random.choice(five_syllable_words)
        self.line2 = random.choice(seven_syllable_words)
        self.line3 = random.choice(
            [word for word in five_syllable_words if word != self.line1]
        )

    def __str__(self):
        return self.line1 + ". " + self.line2 + ". " + self.line3 + ". "


while True:
    haiku = Haiku(five_syllable_phrases, seven_syllable_phrases)
    text = str(haiku)
    display.scroll(text, wait=False)
    speech.say(text, speed=100)
    sleep(random.randint(5000, 30000))
```

The default speech settings are very much like an old fashioned speak-n-spell toy so the attributes need to be tweaked to get a slower and more reasonable 
version to be understandable.
