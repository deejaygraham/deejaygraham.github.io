title: Microbit Haiku Generator
tags: [microbit, python]
---

Continuing the theme of "random" text generation, a good candidate is the pseudo-haiku. There are many different ways of generating a haiku but many of them 
not necessarily the most authentic or in the spirit of the art form. Here I am taking the least effortful approach. I used MS Copilot to generate lists of 
common five and seven syllable phrases to act as a source text from which to generate the haiku sticking to the 5-7-5 syllable formula.


## Code

### haiku.py

```python
from microbit import *
import random
import speech

```

The default speech settings are very much like an old fashioned speak-n-spell toy so the attributes need to be tweaked to get a slower and more reasonable 
version to be understandable.
