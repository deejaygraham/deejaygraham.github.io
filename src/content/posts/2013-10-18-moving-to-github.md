A long, long time ago, my initial forays into the open source .Net eco-system 
were done on [codeplex](http://codeplex.com). I was initially attracted by 
the codeplex team's blogging of their development, their use of scrum to 
iteratively build out the platform and features like hosting binaries and 
download management as well as source code hosting. 

I was one of the first adopters of their Hg option for source repository and 
I found the conversion experience quick and easy. I asked for my repo to be 
converted by email, someone from codeplex emailed me back and it was done. 
Magic!

That was my first introduction to using DVCS in anger since hearing about 
[bazaar](bazaar.canonical.com/) at an [ACCU](http://accu.org) conference and 
I've never looked back.

Since my conversion (and using TFS at work re-inforced this) I have been 
experimenting with other DVCS and getting more and more fond of [git](git-scm.com/). 

Now that I have my blog over at github, I think I'm going to take the leap 
and move my open source projects over here and try to reduce the spread of 
them across lots of different services.
