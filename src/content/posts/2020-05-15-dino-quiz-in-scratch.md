I'm teaching a new beginner class in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and came up with this fun version of a maths quiz
featuring a dinosaur and a bat.

I did this mainly to show some more animation features, how to use more than one sprite, how to assign scripts to each part of the application
and to have them interact using broadcast messages and events.
