A great talk from Sam Laing about the "right" way to do testing in an agile team and the agile testing mindset.

My takeaways:

* Testing is an activity like every other, not a stage to go through.
* Ask "How do we test that?" on a regular basis.
* Aim to do test tasks, like write a test plan, first - before any dev work.
* Replace a test stage in your process with a "Show Me" stage so that even testing activities gets reviewed by someone else on the team.
