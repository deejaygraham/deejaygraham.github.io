Imagine for a moment, you are writing a book about agile techniques and 
how they can be applied in the context of coaching a software team.

![cover](/img/posts/dream-team-nightmare/ptdream_xlargecover.webp)

You *might* structure it in a nice, linear fashion, explaining the history 
of agile, enumerating each technique in turn and explaining when and how 
it could be used. 

You *might* be tempted to invent a fictional company to illustrate points 
and to smuggle in some of your real-world experience without upsetting your 
past customers.

You probably won't put in enough examples and the ones you do have will have 
little depth.

What you almost certainly wouldn't do is disguise it as a "choose your own adventure" 
book. That would be silly. Which is why 
[Portia Tung's](https://twitter.com/portiatung) approach in 
[The Dream Team Nightmare](http://pragprog.com/book/ptdream/the-dream-team-nightmare) is 
such genius. 

Instead of wandering around dark corridors picking doors at random, finding 
treasure and killing monsters; Portia has created a world where you are an 
agile coach brought into a company to help their development teams work through 
problems with agile adoption, process, individuals and communication with the 
larger organisation. 

Each chapter builds the story, demonstrates one or more techniques in that 
context, and presents a choice at the end. Your job is to decide what to do 
next and jump to the corresponding chapter. There are no, "Sorry, you were 
just eaten by a Grue" surprise consequences to wrong decisions, but as in real 
life, an accumulation of "wrong" answers leads to you leaving the adventure 
early. The book is structured so that you can retrace your steps to find 
where you went wrong and learn what was the right decision to make.

What I remember about the choose-your-own-adventure books (and similar computer 
games) was as fun as they were were, you never really learned anything more than 
the depth (or shallowness) of their creators creativity and sense of "humour". 
With Portia's book you will find a lot of techniques that are modelled well in the 
narrative, plenty of starting material for you to take and research independently 
*and* you will almost certainly learn something even if you aren't trying! 

The book is very quick to read all the way through and is a lot of fun. I 
learned more than I thought I would but the downside of this book is that 
there really aren't any others like it in the field. It seems even more of 
a chore to go back to reading real books.
