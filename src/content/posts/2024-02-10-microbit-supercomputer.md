A slightly larger microbit application today with an homage to the [Connection Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_Machine)
super computer that featured in the movie Jurassic Park. More particularly, a microscopic recreation of the LED blinkenlights 
from the CM-5 LED front panel. The wikipedia page shows a gif of one of the "random" patterns that the front panel could show while 
the machine was working.

I have read that the CM-5 used to have several modes for the LED display and that the patterns generated, while looking random, 
were actually carefully curated and based on a specific algorithm. Here I've gone for a slightly simpler approach
generating an initial image and then moving the top and bottom halves of the image in different directions y using the shift_right 
and shift_left functions on image. New stripes of pixels are created to fill in the gap created by each shift and the new image
is recomposed by bit blitting (not a thing I've done since my younger days as a windows programmer) part of the bottom image
onto the top image to create a sort of sliding conveyor belt effect.
