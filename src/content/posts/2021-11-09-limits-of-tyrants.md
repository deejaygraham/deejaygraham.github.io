The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions 
yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been 
exciting, agitating, all-absorbing, and for the time being, putting all other
tumults to silence. It must do this, or it does nothing. If there is no struggle there 
is no progress. Those who profess to favour freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men 
who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and 
lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle 
may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it be both moral and physical, but it 
must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. 
Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact 
measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue 
till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants 
are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.
