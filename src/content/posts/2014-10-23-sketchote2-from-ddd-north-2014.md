Here's another sketchnote from the <a href="http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/">Developer Developer Developer North
2014 conference</a>.

This time it was [Richard Dalton](http://www.twitter.com/richardadalton)'s
"Burn Out is Real, and its coming to get YOU", a very brave and important talk
on how developers are susceptible to burn out and what you can do to recognise
them symptoms and how to avoid it.
