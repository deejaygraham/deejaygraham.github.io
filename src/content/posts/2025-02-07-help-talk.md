I have had a new talk selected for the upcoming DDD North 2025 which will be at Hull University on 22nd February. I've included here a rough draft of the talk and will add some photographs later. 
This talk is about how we debug and solve problems, but also about how we, as programmers live inside our own heads a lot of the time, and how we can catch ourselves when we fall into unproductive 
patterns of thought.

## Title

Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!

## Abstract 

We developers spend our lives going from "Everything is terrible" to "I'm awesome!" and back again, often more than once in the same day. Occasionally, we can find ourselves stuck either 
in old, unfamiliar code, with a bug, a broken test, or just general overwhelm of too much to do in too little time. 

Let's talk about strategies to recognize when that is happening, some ways to get unstuck when you don't know where to go or how to get there. 

We developers spend our lives going from "Everything is terrible" to "I'm awesome!" and back again, often more than once in the same day. We often find ourselves with too much to 
do in too little time; stuck on understanding old, unfamiliar code; a bug that doesn't make sense; a broken test or a test that should be failing but isn't.
 
Let's talk about strategies to recognize when this is happening and some ways to get unstuck when you don't know where to go or how to get there."
