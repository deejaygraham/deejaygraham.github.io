I have had a new talk selected for the upcoming DDD North 2025 which will be at Hull University on 22nd February. I've included here a rough draft of the talk and will add some photographs later. 
This talk is about how we debug and solve problems, but also about how we, as programmers live inside our own heads a lot of the time, and how we can catch ourselves when we fall into unproductive 
patterns of thought.

## Title

Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!

## Abstract 

We developers spend our lives going from "Everything is terrible" to "I'm awesome!" and back again, often more than once in the same day. Occasionally, we can find ourselves stuck either 
in old, unfamiliar code, with a bug, a broken test, or just general overwhelm of too much to do in too little time. 

Let's talk about strategies to recognize when that is happening, some ways to get unstuck when you don't know where to go or how to get there. 


## Introduction

Hello everyone, thanks for being here. My name is Derek Graham, here's some of 
my socials if you would like to get in contact after the talk or grab me at the 
end or anytime during DDD.

I have been a developer for a really long time but in the last year I have been 
working as a software architect for a European team within Sage. 

I started thinking about this talk a while ago in the summer for several reasons. 

One is I mentor a number of developers who are earlier in their careers and often 
need to talk about problem solving, debugging, all those kinds of things where 
stuff doesn't go to plan and they don't know where to do.

I also work with a non-profit in South Africa called We Think Code who help people 
from non-traditional backgrounds gain access to training and careers in computing where they would not normally have a chance. I mentor a small team of second-year students who are approaching more challenging projects getting ready
to leave the bootcamp atmosphere and start an internship at a real company. This is a joy to do but frequently they come up with problems they have no idea how to solve.

The final reason for thinking about this talk is I took up paddle boarding in the summer because it looked like good exercise, got you out in the fresh air, and it looked super easy to do. It's a 10ft x 3ft rigid board, a bit like a surf board so there's loads of room to be really secure and balanced. Right? Turns out you can watch all the videos on youtube but until you actually get out on the water, you don't realise that actually you are trying to stand on a bucking bronco. Water has lumps and bumps in it and you might not realise this until you are far from shore 
in the middle of a deserted lake and you can't remember how you were supposed to 
do things. 

Don't worry this talk is more about development and less about my failures in my 
new sport.


## Stuck?

When I say stuck I mean when you are working on some code - using a library, an API, your own code from six months ago - and you can't get it to 
behave the way you want to. And so you're not sure where to go next...

Who here has ever had a problem they didn't know how to solve? Who here has ever felt like you can't make progress because you are just out of ideas?

Keep your hands up, look around at all the other terrible developers in the room.! 

That's the job isn't it. As a young developer I thought I would eventually get 
so good that I would never get stuck and I would know the answers to all my problems. Turns out that day never came. But that's the job, that's what we get 
paid for. We solve problems, sure but we spend most of our lives being wrong.
Something won't work, it won't work then it does. We don't get a parade for making 
that tiny bit work, we maybe will congratulate ourselves with a cup of coffee, but 
we move onto the next bit of the problem where we are going to be equally wrong 
until we aren't any more. But what happens when we don't know how to move on 
get fix this one piece?

Problem solving is difficult and it takes time. It's ok to get stuck, it's 
important what we do after we recognize we are stuck.

## Won't AI fix it?


Let's talk about some things you can do. 

## Get it out of your head

One of the best ways to immediately fix the problem is to externalise it. Some people find it useful to write a summary of the problem in text - write an email,
post something stack overflow, write a blog post, create a github issue, increasingly to talk to chatgpt or copilot?

The idea being if you can write a clear summary of the problem you have rather than it just going round and round in your brain, then you can often solve your own problem before you post the message, hit send or whatever. 

This might work for you, but I don't find it very effective in practice.

The reason for this is that it's too easy for your brain to skip over words, assume other bits of the problem and generally take shortcuts. Much more 
effective is talking out loud.

## Ducks

I learned this practice from the Pragmatic Programmers book many years ago, and 
it's called a Rubber Duck. You take a rubber duck, a toy, a pet, a real person 
and get them to sit and listen while you explain out loud what your problem is. 

Explain the problem, and talk about what is actually happening not what you 
think is happening. 

The reason it can be a rubber duck or a pet or a person with no knowledge of your 
problem is that there is a bit of magic that happens when you are forced to put your problem into actual words and speak them out loud. 

Who has had this experience? You are writing an essay for school, an email, a letter and you print it, send it and then discover you have made a spelling mistake or missed out a word in the middle of a sentence or used the wrong word?

Reading in your head lets you skip over lots of errors and shortcut what you 
really mean in a way that speaking aloud - as if you were reading from a script - 
does not. The act of speaking aloud and actually listening to yourself too - really makes it such that you can often come up with an answer before you have 
finished speaking. 

How could I be wrong about this? Feynman?

## Make it Smaller

Often a problem appears to be unapproachable because it seems so vast. Make the problem smaller by getting rid of unnecessary elements. Even if you think it's as 
small as can be, I guarantee it's not as small as you can make it. Make it smaller still.

Try to isolate where the problem might be.
The whole application is broken - what have you added recently that you are 
least confident about?
What is most likely the place with the most "magic" happening?
Where am I making the most assumptions about? (this may not be easy)

## Use half-split method

Automated by git bisect - give it last known good commit, first bad commit. Will take a commit somewhere in the middle and check that. If it's ok, move towards right if not, move towards left. 
Gets to problem quicker than checking each commit in turn.

### Delete Code

Physically delete code - it's in source control you can get it back.
Large scary function? 
Extract some code into a separate method - give it a useful name 
Maybe write a test for your new method. Is the problem in the moved code 
or is it still in the old code?

### If you have some candidate code

Copy code into a console program and just run the code surrounded with 
hard-coded data

Write a unit test for it if you can.

If the code can't be pulled out, use ASSERT statements as pre- and post-conditions 
in the code to check for things that absolutely have to be true - but you 
haven't checked. 

Check file names, method names, If you say it's definitely got to load the DLL 
from disk and you know the DLL is there - make sure it's spelled correctly
and it's in the right place, and it's the right version. Use tooling to help 
with these things. Is there a space, are letters in the wrong order?

Build a small PoC with just the pieces you need and see how it works. 

## Spike

If you are using a new technology. Write a spike solution - a piece of code that you can use to learn and gain understanding but you will throw away. Do the simplest possible thing. Call one function, Get back one piece of data. Start with the smallest thing. Write a test for it if you can. 
Make a walking skeleton which can be a console app that loads the library, 
pushes some hard-coded data into it and gets something you can print out on the screen. Work on the piece that scares you the most, or that you know the least about.


## Tests

Write some tests
Test are great for attacking a problem from a different angle. Often code in an application can work accidentally by being called in only one way and in a specific order where a test is more free to explore different configurations and options available to you. Can you make the application fail but the test work?

Tests give you a tight feedback loop to be able to quickly evaluate what is working and what is not, and what used to work and suddenly breaks as you add more to it. 

Make sure to write failing tests by varying data to a passing test so that you 
know the test isn't passing accidentally. 

Are you able to write tests for most pieces but maybe one piece is resisting testing? That may be where the problem lies, it may be using data or functionaliy - perhaps from elsewhere in the program - you don't yet understand. Global data, external files? Clock? Network? Database?

## Integration tests

Can you write an integration test for the whole of the problem area? Again half-split method - if it fails. Move to the next level down, can you split the integration test into two parts. Test both sides which side fails, begin to work that out. 

## Shitty

Shitty first draft -  can be useful if you are writing and don't know where to start, give yourself permission to make the worse possible version of that thing


Keep a paper list of questions or assumptions you have made. Keep it to one side so you can add to it but it keeps your mind clear for what you are currently investigating but you can add to it as things occur to you. 


## Distract Yourself

Walk away - Go home, do something else and come home the next day.
Relax
Take a show
Nap (working from home)
Physical exercise - executive function, lifts mood
Play a game
Read a book
Move onto another problem - mechanical 

Allow yourself time to process in the background. Staying at work and slogging through feels like the responsible, hard-working thing to do but we don't appreciate when we are tired our executive function drops dramatically and something you might work on all night, can come to you in 5 minutes after a good night's sleep. 

## Çaution 
Don't wake up in the night with the "solution" the number of times I have done this, and either forgotten in the morning or written it down and it's entire gibberish - don't trust that. 

When you come back, you have had a change to incubate the problem, can come back to it with a fresh perspective or even need to relearn something about it.

## Tips

Keep records - write down what you have tried, what your assumptions are 
- what you have tried and what the results are. This will stop you spiralling around trying the same things over and over. 

Document the code
As you go along. Might be useful for you and the team later or maybe just throw away?

Learn some UML - draw a diagram of what is happening or the links between bits of code as you work out what is happening and your understaning grows.

## Ready for next time

Remember getting stuck is part of your job in working out problems. 

Learn new ways of solving problems
Pair with someone new
Read someone elses code - github for similar applications or problem domains
Learn a new language - PP Languages are focussed on a specific set of problems to solve. Learning new can expand you way of approaching problems even if they are not directly applicable to the framework or language you are using today.
