Here's a scale that I've seen <a href="https://twitter.com/lunivore">Liz Keogh</a> use in a couple of talks about
<a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/videos/cynefin-framework-introduction/">Cynefin</a> and the impact it has on
deciding if estimation is worthwhile or even possible in your current situation. I find establishing where we are on
this scale to be enormously helpful before going into an estimation meeting (or maybe using as justification for canceling a meeting).

5. Nobody has ever done it before.
6. Someone outside the organization has done it before (probably a competitor).
7. Someone in our organization has done it before.
8. Someone in the team has done it before.
9. We all know how to do it.
