title: Estimating Complexity

Here's a scale that I've seen <a href="https://twitter.com/lunivore">Liz Keogh</a> use in a couple of talks about
<a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/videos/cynefin-framework-introduction/">Cynefin</a> and the impact it has on
deciding if estimation is worthwhile or even possible in your current situation. I find establishing where we are on
this scale to be enormously helpful before going into an estimation meeting (or maybe using as justification for canceling a meeting).

1. Nobody has ever done it before.
1. Someone outside the organization has done it before (probably a competitor).
1. Someone in our organization has done it before.
1. Someone in the team has done it before.
1. We all know how to do it

Or conversely, I have seen it this way:

1. Just about everyone in the world has done this - a JFDI* task
1. Lots of people have done this, including someone on our team.
1. Someone in our company has done this, or we have access to expertise.
1. Someone in the world did this, but not in our organization - and we don't know how
1. Nobody in the world has ever done this before. - Spike or experimentation needed

*JFDI - Just Flippin' Do It. Something well understood that has no complexity or dependency on externality, just needs the time to physically do it. This was a term 
I originally learned from Jennifer Stapleton, of DSDM fame.
