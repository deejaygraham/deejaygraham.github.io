deciding if estimation is worthwhile or even possible in your current situation. I find establishing where we are on 
this scale to be enormously helpful before going into an estimation meeting (or maybe using as justification for canceling a meeting).

3. Someone in our organization has done it before.
2. Someone in the team has done it before.
