I have been experimenting on and off with making my own sketchbooks and wanted to try something a bit
more ambitious, making a cover and hand sewing the binding for multiple signatures to make a thicker
sketchbook. The skill of stitching signatures together with the correct tension and without tearing
the paper is one I have to work on but I was quite pleased with the first attempt.

The cover uses paper designed by Emma Bridgewater.

The signatures are paper from an old watercolour book.
