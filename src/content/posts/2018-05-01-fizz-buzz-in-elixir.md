title: FizzBuzz in Elixir
tags: [code]
---

Here's the result of a recent junior dev coding dojo, tackling fizz buzz in a totally new language for us - elixir.

```elixir

{% include 'code/elixir/fizzbuzz.exs' %}

```

Everyone's minds were blown with the inside-out-ness of the solution, providing several different implementations with
the matching code "outside" of the body of the function.

We ran the dojo using the wonderful <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org">cyber-dojo</a> TDD tool (and forgot to change the name
of the module away from the default Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy naming convention).
