Wednesday, the 15th of August 2018 was our usual <a href="http://nebytes.net">NE Bytes</a> developer meetup, ... 
except that it wasn't because we had the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/schmonz/">Amitai Schleier</a> over to visit to 
talk about mob programming and how to replace or enhance a legacy application without rewriting it, using the strangler
pattern.

This was our first time running an event in a new venue - our home for the last four years, campus north, is closing it's doors 
in September - and the Scott Logic offices provided us with a nice intimate atmosphere for gathering together to work on 
some code.

Amitai started off by introducing mob programming and the strangler pattern before moving onto the coding scenario and the code we, as a mob, 
were to build on. It's fair to say we had a few technical challenges with connections, keyboards and mice but our newly formed 
mob coped with those problems, managed to make progress on new features in the code with Amitai's guidance and gathered 
confidence as the evening proceeded. We swapped out drivers every 4 minutes which meant everyone who wanted to was able to 
experience driving for the navigator and the mob.

Here are a few photos from the night.

As a new mob, we were working in an unfamiliar IDE on unfamiliar code, in what was, for many a strange, new language and in front 
of lots of people who were relative strangers AND typing in front of strangers while standing up! The strength of Amitai's approach - his 
facilitation and coaching skills - meant that none of this mattered. We were able to complete all of the features and have fun 
doing it. We would love to have Amitai back when he's next within travelling distance of Newcastle.
