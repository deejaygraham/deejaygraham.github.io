A dreadful pun on the names of Hubert and Stuart Drefus
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>, star of
one of my wife's favorite films.

I first became aware of the [Dreyfus Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) from
[Merlin Mann](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/197493983/am-i-obsessed-with-the-dreyfus-model-of-skill)'s work
and Andy Hunt's book [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning).

The original paper on skill acquisition is [here](http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA084551&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf)
