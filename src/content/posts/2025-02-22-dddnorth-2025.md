Today I had the great pleasure of attending the always wonderful [DDD North](https://www.dddnorth.co.uk) conference 
at the Hull University campus and giving a talk titled "Help! I've fallen and I can't get up" which was originally inspired 
by my taking up the sport of paddleboarding last summer, but is really about debugging and getting unstuck when you don't 
know how to get going again.

  We developers spend our lives going from "Everything is terrible" to "I'm awesome!" and back again - more than once 
  in the same day. We often find ourselves with too much to do in too little time; stuck on understanding old, 
  unfamiliar code; a bug that doesn't make sense; a broken test or a test that should be failing but isn't.

  Let's talk about strategies to get unstuck when you don't know where to go or how to get there.
