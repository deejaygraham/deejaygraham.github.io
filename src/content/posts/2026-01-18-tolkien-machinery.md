...There is the tragedy and despair of all machinery laid bare. Unlike art which is content to create a new secondary 
world in the mind, it attempts to actualize desire, and so to create power in the World; and that cannot really be done
with any real satisfaction, Labour-saving machinery only creates endless and worse labour. And in addition to this 
fundamental disability of a creature, is added the Fall, which makes our devices not only fail of their desire but 
turn to new and horrible evil...
