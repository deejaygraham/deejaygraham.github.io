title: Murdering Folders. In Ruby
tags: [ruby, code]

My mp3 player tends to accumulate sub-folders in my podcast folder as my
podcast app syncs with it and podcast episodes come and go. Rather than leave
them unoccupied and unloved, I use this script to "tidy them up". By killing them.

```ruby

{% include 'code/ruby/clean.rb' %}

```
