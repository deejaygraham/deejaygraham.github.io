A text heavy sketchnote this time from a speech by Cory Doctorow at Hieroglyph on the theme of
computers and how they can be turned against their owners when we try to subvert their
Turing-machine-ness in order to protect copyright holders.

I added a [spy-vs-spy](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy) character being
chased by the [xkcd Cory](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Comics_featuring_Cory_Doctorow)
to illustrate the last sentence. Overall, I was not hugely happy with the way this one turned
out so I may revisit it at a later date.
