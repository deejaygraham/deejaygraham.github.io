I'm currently running a series of weekly [cyber-dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/)
sessions for some of our testers who are working towards becoming developers so
that they can get a feel for working on code and doing TDD.

Each week we pick a kata and implement it in pairs or randori style with
a projector. To keep everyone focussed on the task at hand I wrote the following
"program" to explain the TDD process in simple terms.

    10 Think about what you want to achieve
    20 Write a little test for what you need
    30 Run the tests and make sure this test fails
    40 Write just enough code to make the test pass
    50 Run the tests and make sure this test passes
    60 Can anything be improved?
    70 Make improvements
    80 Run the tests again
    90 Goto 10

Of course, if I were serious about TDD, I should have written tests around
this too ;)
