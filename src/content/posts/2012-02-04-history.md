Biographical history, as taught in our public schools, is still largely a 
history of boneheads: ridiculous kings and queens, paranoid political 
leaders, compulsive voyagers, ignorant generals - the flotsam and jetsam 
of historical currents. The men who radically altered history, the great 
scientists and mathematicians, are seldom mentioned, if at all.
