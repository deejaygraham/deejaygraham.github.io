Biographical history, as taught in our public schools, is still largely a
history of boneheads: ridiculous kings and queens, paranoid political
leaders, compulsive voyagers, ignorant generals - the flotsam and jetsam
of historical currents. The men who radically altered history, the great
scientists and mathematicians, are seldom mentioned, if at all.
