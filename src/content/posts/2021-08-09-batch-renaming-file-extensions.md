A tiny snippet of code I hardly ever need, until I desperately need it and find I've forgotten how
Get-ChildItem works:)

```powershell

{% include 'code/powershell/Rename-Files.ps1' %}

```

Most recently I needed to batch change several hundred .html files as .markdown and didn't fancy
doing that by hand.
