The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it's profitable 
to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes 
too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, 
they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs 
out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back 
of the theater.
