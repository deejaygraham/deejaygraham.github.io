What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner,
was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out
or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to meas well. And what
had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who write it took
delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So
I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out
its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.
