Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force 
asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. 
Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk 
of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the 
system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.
