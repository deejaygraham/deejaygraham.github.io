I am (one of three) speaking at the Nigel Wright Technology meetup tonight with my talk [The Elements of Style](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/the-elements-of-style-191457045/191457045) 
all about how we can break out of the traditional ways of development working to embrace pair programming, mob programming and experience strong-style pairing as a 
potential antidote to the normal scatter-gather mode of working we use in most traditional software teams. 

We start at 5.30PM at the Maldron Hotel in Newcastle city centre.
