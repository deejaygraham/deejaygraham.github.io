My twitter friend [Mauro Toselli](https://twitter.com/xlontrax) of Sketchnote Army fame (and more things too numerous to mention) started 
another round of his secret sketchnoter game a couple of weeks ago. It's a bit like the secret santa traditional that you sometimes see 
in offices where each person in a group is allocated another person to buy a gift for such that they are all secret from one another until 
the time comes for gift giving. 

Here each person is allocated someone and uses publicly available information from twitter or wherever to come up with a sketchnote about that person. 
This is my first time trying this and, entirely at random, I was allocated Mauro himself. So here's the sketchnote I did for him, imagining all 
the things he does as shops or buildings existing in the game he devised, Phrenville.
