<a href="https://twitter.com/shiffman">Daniel Shiffman</a>, one of the geniuses behind the <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> language and
the book <a href="http://learningprocessing.com/">Learning Processing</a> has a really interesting book on more advanced concepts in computer science
using Processing. It's called <a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/">The Nature of Code</a> and I can feel I'm going to be using it heavily in
my next programming courses. The book covers lots of different simulations and algorithms: vectors and forces, physics simulations in general,
cellular automata, fractals and even some AI stuff.

The github repo companion to the book (for python) is <a href="https://github.com/nature-of-code/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-Python">here</a>.
