Running up to a new Maker's week at the end of July, I was getting a bit bored
with the tamagotchi example that uses the accelerometer gestures (shake) to wake up a virtual pet. When the pet is asleep it shows a sleepy icon and you can shake it awake for a few seconds, when it shows a happy face.

I came up with a similar idea to simulate a coin toss using shaking and showing one of two images based on heads or tails.

```python

{% include 'code/python/microbit/coin-flipper.py' %}

```
