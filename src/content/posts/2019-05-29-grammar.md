Talking about the importance of grammar, spelling and punctuation with a mentee group. I have just spent 10 minutes looking at code 
I just typed wondering why the computer hates it. I've only just noticed that a comma is where a full stop should be. 

The computer accepts my apology and we go on again. How's your day?
