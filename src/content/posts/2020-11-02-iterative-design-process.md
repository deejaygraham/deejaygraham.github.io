The design process is an iterative one. I will tell you one thing which can go wrong with it if you are not in
the laboratory. In my terms design consists of:

- Flowchart until you think you understand the problem.
- Write code until you realize that you donâ€™t.
- Go back and re-do the flowchart.
- Write some more code and iterate to what you feel is the correct solution.
