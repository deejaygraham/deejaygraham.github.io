Talking to some junior developers today, I was struck again by how much software developers identify
themselves with a particular tech stack or programming language. Along with that they may decide that _your_
preferred language is not a _real_ language and therefore _you_ are not worthy of respect.

I think this is fundamentally wrong since it's much more likely these days that you will start on one
tech stack and language and it won't be long before you are adopting another and another as different
problems present themselves. Which programming language you choose to solve a problem can go a long way
to making your job as a programmer easier or harder depending on how well that choice fits the pardigms
of the solution space.

That conversation made me think about all the languages I have used in my career. It's quite a list (and several have come back more than once) but it
doesn't include any that I have _just_ played around with to see how they worked etc. That list would truly be too long.

In order:

- Assembly Language (HP machine, can't remember which)
- Pascal
- C
- QuickBasic
- Pascal
- C
- C++
- C and Clipper
- Smalltalk
- C++
- C
- Assembly x86
- Java
- C++
- Visual Basic
- Weird Visual Block Language
- C++
- Visual Basic
- C#
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Smalltalk
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- Elixir
- PowerShell
- JavaScript

I remember reading the Pragmatic Programmer's book in something like 2000 and really taking to heart the advice that we should learn a new programming language each year to keep us fresh and widen our horizons for
how we can solve problems.
