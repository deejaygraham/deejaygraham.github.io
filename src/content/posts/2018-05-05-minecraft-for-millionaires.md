If you were a millionaire, living in a minecraft-kind-of-world, I'm sure you would want to have an enormously ostentatious fish tank for your block-shaped
tropical fish to swim in.

```python

{% include 'code/python/minecraft/fishtank.py' %}

```

Now that the fish are taken care of, the minecraft millionaire about town might like to own their own human fish tank, which we usually call a swimming pool. The code that worked for the fish tank can be sunk into the ground and work just as well as a lovely swimming pool.
