If history is to be creative, to anticipate a possible future without denying the past, 
it should, I believe, emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes 
of the past when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, 
to join together, occasionally to win. I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that 
our future may be found in the past's fugitive moments of compassion rather than in 
its solid centuries of warfare.
