Please, don't worry so much. Because in the end, none of us have very long on this Earth. Life is fleeting. And if you're ever distressed, cast your eyes to the summer sky when the
stars are strung across the velvety night. And when a shooting star streaks through the
blackness, turning night into day... make a wish and think of me. Make your life spectacular.
