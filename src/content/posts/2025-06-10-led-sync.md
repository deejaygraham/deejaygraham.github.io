title: LED Sync
tags: [microbit, python]

Moving away from music for the moment, this project is using each LED on the microbit display as a separate blinking light. 
I saw this as more of a long running art installation, I create 25 instances of the Blinker class, one for each LED on the 
display, each with a subtly different on/off blink rate. This means that some of the leds will blink together and most will 
come in and out of synch with each other at different rates and at different times as the blink rates line up and drift apart. 

## Code

```python
from microbit import *
import random


class Blinker:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = max(0, min(x, 4))
        self.y = max(0, min(y, 4))
        self.brightness = 0
        self.cycle_time = random.randint(28, 32)

    def update(self, tick):
        if tick % self.cycle_time == 0:
            self.brightness = 9 if self.brightness == 0 else 0

    def display(self):
        display.set_pixel(self.x, self.y, self.brightness)


leds = []

for x in range(5):
    for y in range(5):
        leds.append(Blinker(x, y))

i = 0
while True:
    for led in leds:
        led.update(i)
        led.display()
    print(str(i))
    i += 1
    sleep(10)
```

The display behaviour reminds me a little bit of the game of life where some patterns emerge, flash on and off for 
a few cycles then give way to another pattern and some small patterns come and go with more regular frequency. The 
display also reminds me of the micro supercomputer display I created a while back.
