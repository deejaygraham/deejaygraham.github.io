A nice example of code analysis and refactoring to improve readability from an old (maybe public information or training?) film with the involvement of Gerald Weinberg and Tom Plum. 

I set this as "homework" for some graduate developers so it will be interesting to see what they make of it and how closely it aligns with the things we think about today in our
