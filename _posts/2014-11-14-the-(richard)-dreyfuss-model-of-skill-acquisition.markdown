A dreadful pun on the names of Hubert and Stuart Drefus
and [Richard Dreyfuss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss), star of 
one of my wife's favorite films.

I first became aware of the [Dreyfus Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) from 
[Merlin Mann](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/197493983/am-i-obsessed-with-the-dreyfus-model-of-skill)'s work 
and Andy Hunt's book [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning).
