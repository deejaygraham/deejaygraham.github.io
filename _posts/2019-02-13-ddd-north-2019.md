Once again I am lucky enough to have been selected to speak at <a href="http://dddnorth.co.uk/">DDD North 2019</a> on the 2nd of March
 at Hull University. I proposed 3 different sessions, two of them technical (Learning Elixir and Refactoring PowerShell for 
 Reliability) and one on developer practices. 
 
The session that got voted for is called "Married to the Mob (programming)" and is a remaster/repeat of the talk I did at 
DDD 2017 (with some improvements) on adopting the practice of mob programming for software development.
