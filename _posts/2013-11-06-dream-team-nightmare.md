Imagine for a moment, you are writing a book about agile techniques and how they can be applied in the context of coaching a software team.

You *might* be structure it in a nice linear fashion, explaining the history of agile, enumerating each technique in turn and explaining when and how it could be used. 

You *might* be tempted to invent a fictional company to illustrate points and to smuggle in some of your real-world experience without upsetting your past customers.

You *might* put  have found a lot of agile theory books to lack enough examples and have little depth to the ones that were offered.

What you almost certainly wouldn't do is disguise it as a "choose your own adventure" book, which is why [Portia Tung's](http://twitter.com/portiatung) approach 
is such genius. 


As fun as those books (and computer games) were, you never really learned anything more than the depth of creativity and sense of "humour" of their creators.

Instead of wandering around dark corridors picking doors at random, finding treasure and killing monsters; Portia has created a world where you are an agile 
coach brought into a company to help their development teams work through process problems with process, individuals and communication with the larger organisation. 

Each chapter outlines a scenario or presents a technique in the context of the story and at the end of the chapter you are presented with a series of choices based 
on what you know at the time. As in real life, the outcome of your choices is not apparent until  

Models..

The book is very quick to read all the way through and is a lot of fun. I learned more than I thought I would 

I found it I wanted more kinds of agile books in this format. Lots of theory but I see the majority of books don't give enough examples and leave 
applying principles or techniques as an exercise for the reader. 

The story puts you in the role of agile coach at a firm where several teams are having issues with agile adoption and their project goals.
and follows you round your days at the company until you resolve the errors or are fired. Supports re-reading a number of times to pick up on where
you went wrong and didn't use your listening skills correctly.

As is common in the genre, chapters are short, and you are asked to pick an action to follow up on as your "next path" in the adventure. 
Frequently, as in life, choices you make aren't immediately obvious as good or bad but a number of bad decisions see you let go from your contract
 early while running a good adventure sees you staying longer and helping to fix more issues. More about the sequence of small decisions
 leads to particular outcomes, rather than traditional areas where the going through the wrong door caused you to be eaten by a wolf.
 Again, as in life, usually your interactions with people determine the success of the project.
 
Found myself wishing for other books in this genre to pass on to colleagues. Thoroughly recommended.

Teaches a number of tools that you can use straight away and shows them in context rather than 

Similar way to Cory Doctorow's Little Brother taught technology to young adult's using examples and asides.

Kanban for discussions, building trees, socratic methods,

Follow up reading, and read 10 times at least. Go through first time to pleasure, then bookmark places for research and follow up, see examples of 
techniques in context.

Accidentally learn something. whether you are new to agile or have been doing it for a while.

Good as an illustrate an example of how a technique is used.
