The third and final sketchnote (but actually from the first session of the day)
from the [Developer Developer Developer North 
2014 conference](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/). 

This time it was a talk by [Joel Hammond-Turner](http://www.twitter.com/rammesses) on 
his opinions around what it takes to be successful as a Tech Lead.

Here's the session summary:
