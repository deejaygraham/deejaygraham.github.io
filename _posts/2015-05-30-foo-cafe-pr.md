A couple of days ago I had some exciting news from Michael Tiberg, the founder of Ã˜redev and 
<a href="http://www.foocafe.org">Foo Cafe</a>.

He wanted to use my sketchnote of the opening meeting of Foo Cafe as a promotional poster! They 
took the scanned image, cleaned it up a little and added some colour. Their plan is to print it 
up on huge posters to promote Foo Cafe around universities and developer hang outs in Sweden!
