One of my favourite talks explaining why XP does what it does in software development is 
<a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains">J.B. Rainsberger's</a> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSes_PexXcA">7 minutes, 26 seconds, and the Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development</a>

Joe saw a sketchnote I had done on this talk and asked if I could help him out...

He was considering revamping his blog (and maybe other of his sites later) and asked if he could use 
one of my illustrations - a portrait of him - on the site. Joe has indirectly helped me a lot over the years 
through blog posts and videos of his talks so, of course, I said yes. The result is below 
or you can see the real thing <a href="https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/">here</a>
