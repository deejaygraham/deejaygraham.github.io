A couple of days ago I had some exciting news from Michael Tiberg at Foo Cafe. He wanted to use 
my sketchnote of the opening meeting of Foo Cafe as a promotional poster! They took the scanned 
image, cleaned it up a little and added some colour. Their plan is to print it up on huge posters 
to promote Foo Cafe around universities and developer hang outs!
