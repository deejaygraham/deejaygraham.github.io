A text heavy sketchnote this time from a speech by [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com) at 
[Hieroglyph](http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/) on the theme of computers and how they can be turned against 
their owners when we try to subvert their Turing-machine-ness in order 
to protect copyright holders.

I added a [spy-vs-spy](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy) character being 
chased by the [xkcd Cory](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Comics_featuring_Cory_Doctorow) 
to illustrate the last sentence.

I was not hugely happy with the way this one turned out so I may revisit it 
at a later date.
