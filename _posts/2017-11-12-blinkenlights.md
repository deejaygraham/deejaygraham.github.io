A tiny snippet of code often used when the microbit is not showing anything
specifically on the screen but you want to indicate that something is happening
in the background - like it's broadcasting on radio.

```python

{% include code/python/microbit/blinkenlights.py %}

```

It turns the centre pixel of the display on and off at a frequency decided by the polling interval.
