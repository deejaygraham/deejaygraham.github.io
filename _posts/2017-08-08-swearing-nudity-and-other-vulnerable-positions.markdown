On the 8th of August <a href="http://wisenoodle.me/">John Le Drew</a> was kind enough to
travel up to Newcastle to talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-North-East/">Agile North East meetup</a>
in <a href="http://campusnorth.co.uk/">Campus North</a>.

John talked about Google's Project Aristotle, psychological safety, trust, teamwork,
motivation and stress with some fun improvisation games thrown in (and minimal nudity). Here
are a few photos from the night.

Proving that the word is not, in fact, "Grease":

A definition of psychological safety:

As usual, sitting at the back of the room, I was able to get some sketchnoting done,
so here's how I interpreted John's talk:
