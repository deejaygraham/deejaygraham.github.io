Ok, I admit it. In a moment of weakness I created an IoC framework, br**IoC**he. 
I am a bad person (and not just because of the horrible pun).

I didn't do it because there aren't already enough out there. It was just 
something I've never done and wanted to see how easy/difficult it was to create 
a minimal viable, simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work framework which was 
just enough to support the requirements I had at the time. 

Turns out it was easy!

Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/deejaygraham/brioche).
