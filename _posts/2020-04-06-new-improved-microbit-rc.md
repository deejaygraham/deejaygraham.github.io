I've been refinining some of my code from the original remote control car I built using the <a href="http://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=1490">BitBot</a> kit 
across several posts last year.

Things like the remote steering, general handling of the car, some nice features like using the neopixels to signal braking and reversing.

Thinking about it over the last few months I came up with some interesting features and had to work around some limitations. The code is still split between 
two programs, the car itself and the remote control.
