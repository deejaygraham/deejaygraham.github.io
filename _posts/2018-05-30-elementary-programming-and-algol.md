I find it fascinating how much of what the popular programming imagination thinks of as new and exciting was already been thought of a long time ago.

I recently got a copy of "Elementary Programming and Algol" which was written by Keith Nicol in 1965 and what struck me most was 
how contemporary it felt if one ignores references to hardware.
