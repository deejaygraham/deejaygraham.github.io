I wanted to mention a couple of awesome walkthroughs - one old, one newer - dealing a subject I always find fascinating, 
writing interpreters for little languages. 

I discovered a live programming language intended for children called <a href="http://islalanguage.org/">Isla</a> by 
<a href="https://twitter.com/maryrosecook">Mary Rose Cook</a> and after browsing her blog, found an article on 
implementing a <a href="https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp">Lisp interpreter in Javascript</a>.

Mary explains the code in <a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter">an article</a> and a 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqnTvuvXPCc">screencast<a/>.

On to the older version, right at the end of the article, Mary credits Peter Novig and his implementations of lisp 
in Python <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html">lis.py</a> and an improved <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy2.html">lis.py2</a>.

Inspired by these articles, I might have to try an implementation in one of two ways. Either a (not so) tiny .Net version 
or as an interpreter to run on the microbit.
