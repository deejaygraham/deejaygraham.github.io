#Planning Poker Card Design

I have just completed and checked in some designs for [planning poker cards](https://github.com/deejaygraham/PlanningPoker/) in png format.

We occasionally use [Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) in our scrum story estimation process, so I designed some to 
meet our needs rather than buying them in.

There are three decks currently, each containing their respective story point values and two jokers: "coffee" and "huh?"

## Fibonnacci

Strictly traditional Fibonnacci progression

## Modified Fibonnacci

Modified Fibonnacci is more coarse grained for higher values to represent the greater uncertainty involved in estimating large stories.

## T-Shirt sizes

Just in time for Summer !

Each "deck" consists of 17 "suits", way more than you would need traditionally need but included so you can pick your favourite colours :)
