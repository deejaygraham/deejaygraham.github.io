This sketchnote is from <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North's</a> talk 
from the launch of <a href="http://www.foocafe.org/">Foo Cafe</a> in 2102. 

The main point of Dan's talk is that as developers, deliberateness is a 
good thing but repetition and practicing by rote is not. Concert pianists need to optimise 
for note perfection and be able to perform the same piece again and again to the same high 
standard. Developers hardly ever need to do the same thing twice and are always having to 
learn and tackle new things, so we need to optimise for learning and being comfortable 
with unfamiliarity.
