I'm posting this older code example of a simple evolutionary algorithm to get 
it off my hard drive :) 

I've been interested in [evolutionary algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) 
for a while now with an idea of using them to solve some interesting puzzles
(more of that in a later post, honest).

This is the canonical example provided by Richard Dawkins in his book 
[The Blind Watchmaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker) 
which attempts to start with a random series of letters of the right length and 
by random mutation, generates a quote from Act 3 Scene 2 of Hamlet:

<blockquote>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?</p>
<p>POLONIUS</p>
<p>By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.</p>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>Methinks it is like a weasel.</p>
</blockquote>

Using as many interfaces as I have and using generic types may seem a little like 
overkill but as I said, I am hoping to complete a project using some alternate 
implementations for a more interesting purpose. Stay tuned :)
