<blockquote>
People who dismiss the unemployed and dependent as "parasites" fail to 
understand economics and parasitism.

A successful parasite is one that is not recognized by its host, one that 
can make its host work for it without appearing as a burden. Such is the 
ruling class in a capitalist society.
