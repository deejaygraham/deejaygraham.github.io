Just in time for Halloween, here's a ghost detector that uses the microbit temperature sensor to sense changes in ambient temperature - which we all know from watching supernatural tv shows - is a sure sign that there's a ghost somewhere nearby :)


```python

{% include code/python/microbit/ghost-detector.py %}

```
