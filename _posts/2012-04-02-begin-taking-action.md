<blockquote>
<p>
Begin taking action now, while being neurotic or imperfect or a 
procrastinator or unhealthy or lazy or any other label by which you 
inaccurately describe yourself. Go ahead and be the best imperfect 
person you can be, and get started on those things you want to accomplish 
before you die.
