A little while ago I was introduced to the idea of sketchnoting by [Mike Rohde](http://rohdesign.com/) and the [sketchnote army](http://www.sketchnotearmy.com/). 

I bought [Mike's book](http://rohdesign.com/book) and decided to try the method for taking notes on presentations I attend and during training sessions. I found it to be a great tool for retaining information and 
for refreshing your memory once a presentation is long in the past.

A few weeks ago, **I** needed to do a presentation on [deliberate practice](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/2011/02/deliberate-practice.html), TDD and using [cyber-dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/) 
as a [TDD platform](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/p/cyber-dojo_2380.html).

I really wanted to spend most of the session live coding a demo rather than inflicting death by powerpoint on the audience. This caused me to hit 
on the idea of using the sketchnote concept in reverse; sketch out the main areas I want to discuss beforehand and use the sketch as the reference material 
to drive my talk instead of written notes. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words and quick glances at the completed sketch meant I was 
able to stay up to date with where I was in the script very easily and without dropping out of "live coding" mode.

I tweeted my idea to [Mike](http://twitter.com/rohdesign) and he responded asking me to share.

So, in the interests of sharing, here it is:
