Here is the rough transcription of my talk from DDD North 2022 at University of Hull.

Hello, thanks for being here and nice to be back at DDD in person. 

My name is derek graham and I am a principal developer at Sage in Newcastel (if anyone can't tell from my accent).

We are looking to hire so if you want to know more about that, please grab me sometime today.

# Possible Lightning Talk

Also for anyone with a little bit of experience delivering software who wants to practice their mentoring skills, 
I want to just mention my work with We Think Code. It's a non-profit organization in SA that provides training for 
people who normally who not have access to university or higher education. It's a two year course and mentors are drawn 
from SA itself, and also from around the world, as counsellors to groups of about 4-6 new developers. It is a great joy
and again, if you would like to be involved or hear more about it, please let me know. 


## Clickbait

Clickbait titles get you in trouble, don't they? Last time I gave a talk at DDD North, it was on ensemble or mob programming
and one part featured this lady, Margaret Rutherford playing the part of Madame Arcati, the medium in Noel Coward's Blythe Spirit.
That was a bit of fun but after the talk it got me thinking what would modern day psychics look like for software development?

I'm not talking about "I can tell someone here has a close connection to someone with the name starting with J" kind of psychic.
"You will meet a tall dark stranger" kind of psychic.

Let me back up a bit...


## Confession

Who hear has felt in the past like they are trapped by their code?

This is a safe space, anything confessing to in here stays in the room? I am giving this talk because I have painted myself into 
so many corners with bad designs that I know exactly what that kind of thing feels like
