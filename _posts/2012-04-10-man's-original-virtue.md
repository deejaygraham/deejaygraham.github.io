Every fact of science was once damned. Every invention was considered impossible. Every discovery was a nervous shock 
to some orthodoxy. Every artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly. The entire web of culture and ‘progress,’ 
everything on earth that is man-made and not given to us by nature, is the concrete manifestation of some man’s refusal 
to bow to Authority. We would own no more, know no more, and be no more than the first apelike hominids if it were 
not for the rebellious, the recalcitrant, and the intransigent. As Oscar Wilde truly said, ‘Disobedience was 
man’s Original Virtue'.
