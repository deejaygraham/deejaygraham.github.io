<blockquote>
There is a cult of ignorance in the United States,
 and there always has been. The strain of
 anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread
 winding its way through our political and cultural life,
 nurtured by the false notion that democracy means
 that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.</blockquote>
