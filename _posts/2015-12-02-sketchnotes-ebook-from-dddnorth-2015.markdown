I've blogged about presenting and live sketchnoting at the [DDD North](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/) 
conference ad nauseam [here]({% post_url 2015-10-26-sketchnoting-at-dddnorth-2015 %}),
[here]({% post_url 2015-10-29-sketchnoting-for-developers %}),
and [here]({% post_url 2015-10-30-sketchnotes-from-dddnorth-2015 %}) as well as a guest post 
on [sketchnote army](http://sketchnotearmy.com/blog/2015/10/30/sketchnoting-at-dddnorth-2015-derek-graham.html).
The sketchnote army post included a lot of the sketchnote contributions from the conference but a few 
more trickled into me in the weeks afterwards.

It seemed a shame that they would be lost forever once they sank below the twitter horizon so after chats with a 
couple of contributors I decided to collect them together in a github repository and publish them as an ebook with 
the help of [Steven Hill](https://www.twitter.com/MrStevenHill). 

This idea wasn't original, I was inspired by [Claudia Sandoval](https://twitter.com/claumsandoval/) who published 
a collection of sketchnotes from [Agile 2015](http://agile2015.agilealliance.org/) earlier in the year.
