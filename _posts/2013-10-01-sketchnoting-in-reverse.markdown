A little while ago I was introduced to the idea of sketchnoting by 
[Mike Rohde](http://rohdesign.com/) and the 
[sketchnote army](http://www.sketchnotearmy.com/) website.

I bought [Mike's book](http://rohdesign.com/book) and I've been using the 
method for taking notes in presentations and during training sessions. I 
found it to be a great tool for retaining information and for refreshing your 
memory once an event is long in the past.

A few weeks ago, **I** needed to do a presentation on 
[deliberate practice](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/2011/02/deliberate-practice.html), 
TDD and using [cyber-dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/) as a 
[TDD platform](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/p/cyber-dojo_2380.html).

I really wanted to spend most of the session live coding a demo with my editor 
window on the screen rather than inflicting death by Powerpoint on the audience. 
My problem was I didn't like the idea of following a written script and I 
didn't have a presentation to follow in case I got lost in the middle.

I hit on the idea of using the sketchnote concept in reverse; sketching out 
the main areas I want to discuss beforehand and use the sketch as reference 
material to drive my talk instead of a script. As they say, a picture is 
worth a thousand words and quick glances at the completed sketch meant I was 
able to keep my place in the presentation very easily and without dropping 
out of "live coding" mode. 

I tweeted my idea to [Mike](http://twitter.com/rohdesign) and he responded 
asking me to share.

I wasn't really prepared for this. My sketch was meant for my eyes only 
(I hid it during the presentation so no-one would be distracted by it) 
but in the interests of sharing, here it is:

Feedback from the session suggests I made the right choice, so it's something 
I'm going to continue. I'm happy with how it turned out, even if it's not 
the most elegant or elaborate it did the job and I would use it again to give 
the same presentation.

<h4>Update</h4>
The original sketchnote got damaged when my moleskine notebook got wet so 
I redid it and enhanced it based on feedback after giving the talk a few 
more times.

Here's a cleaned up scanned image of the new version of the sketchnote
