> When I became convinced that the Universe is natural – that
> all the ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain,
> into my soul, into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling,
> the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the
> dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts, and bars, and
> manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf or a slave.
> There was for me no master in all the wide world – not even in
> infinite space. I was free – free to think, to express my thoughts
> – free to live to my own ideal – free to live for myself and
> those I loved – free to use all my faculties, all my senses –
> free to spread imagination’s wings – free to investigate, to guess
> and dream and hope – free to judge and determine for myself –
> free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the “inspired”
> books that savages have produced, and all the barbarous legends of
> the past – free from popes and priests – free from all the
> “called” and “set apart” – free from sanctified mistakes and holy
> lies – free from the fear of eternal pain – free from the winged
> monsters of the night – free from devils, ghosts and gods. For the
> first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in all the
> realms of thought – no air, no space, where fancy could not spread
> her painted wings – no chains for my limbs – no lashes for my
> back – no fires for my flesh – no master’s frown or threat – no
> following another’s steps – no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl,
> or utter lying words. I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly,
> joyously, faced all worlds.
