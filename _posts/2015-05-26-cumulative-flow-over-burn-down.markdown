title: Cumulative Flow over Burning Down

Today's modest proposal is that scrum teams abandon burndown charts and adopt 
a cumulative flow chart to show progress instead.

## Burning down the house

The traditional burndown chart is a graphical representation of work left against 
time left, usually in a scrum sprint or in a release. Development teams can estimate 
when they will be done by actual progress against time. The projected date when the 
remaining work dips to zero is the earliest ship date.

It seems that many people in the Scrum and the wider agile community become fixated 
on tracking progress using the burn down chart, based on the belief that the number of 
hours remaining in a sprint is related to the actual work left.

They are good for getting rid of the wishful thinking around ship dates and making concrete the 
assumptions.Depends heavily on how well the original time estimates are.

Another problem with this approach is it only shows the work done by the development team - 
usually the coding and testing remaining. As such it's quite a limited view of the total 
effort.

Number of stories delivered is better concentrates on what is actually shipped.

Burn up or burn down?


## Take me to the river

Is it any better?

The Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) is a better tool for tracking and forecasting team 
work. It shows how much work has been done, what is in progress split by sections and how 
much is still waiting to be done. Not only does it give a prediction of completion date, it can 
also give insight into cycle time and bottlenecks in your process.
