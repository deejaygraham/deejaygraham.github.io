Today's modest proposal is that scrum teams abandon burndown charts and adopt 
a cumulative flow chart to show progress instead.

## Burning Down (the house)

The traditional burndown chart tracks the daily amount of work remaining over a 
period of time - typically a sprint or a release. Teams can estimate when 
they will be done by plotting ideal effort and actual progress against time. The 
projected date when the remaining work dips to zero is the earliest ship date.
 
The popularity of the Sprint burndown chart seems to be built on the premise that 
tracking estimates of remaining work 
It seems that many people in the Scrum and the wider agile community get fixated
on tracking progress using the burn down chart.

## Flow 

The Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) is a better tool for tracking and forecasting 
team work. By the use of it you can easily check the current status: how much work has been done, what is in progress and how much is still waiting to be done in the backlog. A Cumulative Flow chart helps to gain insight into issues, cycle time and likely completion dates. It is also indispensable for identifying bottlenecks.
