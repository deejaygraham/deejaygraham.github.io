We had the pleasure of hosting the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/geek_manager/">Meri Williams</a> at the February meeting of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Agile-North-East/events/235774940/">Agile North East</a>.

She gave a fantastic talk and followed it up with some more wide-ranging
Q &amp; A on general agile topics.

The talk was packed with one of the biggest audiences I have seen at Campus North
but I managed to get myself into a quiet corner to do some sketchnoting.
