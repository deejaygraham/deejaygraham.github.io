I was lucky enough to be able to attend the [Developer Developer Developer North 
2014 conference](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/) in Leeds this past weekend.

Unusually for me, I didn't attend any real technical talks but instead opted for 
more of the "softer" [subjects](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/Schedule). 

One of the highlights was [Eve Barabas'](http://www.twitter.com/b_seven_e) talk on 
the differences and similarities between Rubyists and .Net Developers and how her team 
at [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx) have been working to 
resolve the gaps and improve understanding.

This talk was the first one I have tried to live sketchnote and you can see the 
result below.
