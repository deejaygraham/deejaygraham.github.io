Another small bit of code, similar to blinkenlights, that turns on a random pixel then lets it fade out before turning on the next one. The effect is a bit like a lethargic swarm of fireflies or being at a photo call in front of a bunch of very polite, respectful paparazzi :)

```python

{% include code/python/microbit/paparazzi.py %}

```
