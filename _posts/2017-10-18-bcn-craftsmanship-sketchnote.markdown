Ordinarily, the way sketchnotes work is that you a capturing and distilling ideas
from a talk or similar event and presenting them on paper. Twice recently that  
process got turned on its head or inside out or something.

First, I stumbled on a video of a talk by Geoff Bowden at the 2015 Agile Yorkshire
Christmas lightning talks meeting, titled ["Sketchnoting Agile One Doodle at A Time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZTkP6Joqro), in 
which Geoff credits seeing my talk at [DDD North](http://dddnorth.co.uk/) in
October 2015. I had no idea that I was going to be mentioned and it was a little surreal
hearing my own name but still, super cool!

Next, I sketchnoted a slightly controversial talk by [Dan North](https://twitter.com/tastapod)
about how lots of the SOLID guidelines are redundant, wrong or just overly complicated.

This got a huge (for me) storm of feedback about how it was completely wrong, we didn't
understand any of it etc. etc. One nice interaction was from [Eduardo Ferro Aldama](https://twitter.com/eferro) who asked if he could use the sketchnote to illustrate a
point in his upcoming talk at the Barcelong Software Craftsmanship conference.

Once the conference was finished he was kind enough to point me to
his [blog post](http://www.eferro.net/2017/10/simplicidad-para-desarrolladores.html) and
the video [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1013&v=6FDxbCzh2sI).
