I have been running a series of TDD-focussed coding dojos for a while now, 
mainly using the brilliant [cyber-dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/) platform 
developed by [Jon Jagger](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/p/cyber-dojo_2380.html).

I'm hoping to be a lot more regular with them over the next few months but 
at present they are just infrequent enough that I always seem to forget something 
in the setup to the session. 

#### Checklists to the rescue!

This is the current checklist I run through before starting a coding dojo 
session. Hopefully it will be useful to someone else.

##### Deciding to run a dojo

* Find interested attendees
* Agree a venue and date
* Check venue has enough space for all attendees and a few spares
* Check wifi and network coverage for venue.
* Check electrical outlets for venue.
* Book venue for correct date.
* Book food, projector and other "extras".
* Write agenda
	- Expectations
	- Length of time
	- Equipment needed
	- Experience level required
	- Which problem/kata to try?
* Send invitations and add date to calendar
* Print instructions and/or cheatsheets for everyone

##### Immediately before the dojo

* Check [cyber-dojo is online](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/)
* Bring personal laptop
* Bring projector
* Bring Instruction sheets
* Bring Biscuits!
