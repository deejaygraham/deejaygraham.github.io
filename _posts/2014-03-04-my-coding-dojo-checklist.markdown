I have been running a series of TDD-focussed coding dojos for a while now, 
mainly using the brilliant [cyber-dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/) platform 
developed by [Jon Jagger](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/p/cyber-dojo_2380.html).

I'm hoping to be a lot more regular with them over the next few months but 
at present they are just infrequent enough that I always seem to forget something 
in the setup to the session. 

**Checklists to the rescue!** This is the current checklist I run through 
before starting a coding dojo session. Hopefully it will be useful to someone 
else.

**Once you decide to run a dojo** use this checklist:

* Find interested attendees
* Agree a venue and date
* Check venue has enough space for all attendees and a few spares
* Check wifi and network coverage for venue.
* Check electrical outlets for venue.
* Book venue for correct date.
* Book food, projector and other "extras".
* Write the agenda
	- Expectations for the session
	- How long the session will last?
	- What equipment participants need to bring (if any)?
	- Which programming language(s)?
	- What experience level is required?
	- Which problem/kata to try?
* Send invitations and add date to calendar
* Print instructions and/or cheatsheets for everyone

**Immediately before the dojo starts** use this checklist:

* Check [cyber-dojo is online](http://www.cyber-dojo.com/)
* Bring personal laptop
* Bring projector
* Bring Instructions/Cheatsheets
* Bring Biscuits!
