I am a big fan of katas and the idea of deliberate practice in general so
one thing I have not done the whole time I've been involved in sketchnoting
is any kind of practice lettering to try to increase the diversity of typefaces I have available to me with minimal effort.

This is a copy of an exercise I saw somewhere but can't recall where - probably
on twitter maybe?
