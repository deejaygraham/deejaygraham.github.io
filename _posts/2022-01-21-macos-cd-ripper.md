As an evolving project, I'm keeping notes here for a python script to rip audio CDs to mp3 on my Mac.

Starting with the script

```python

{% include code/python/cd-ripper.py %}

```

and the .abcde.conf file in the home directory

```

{% include code/python/abcde.conf %}

```

There is a lot of experimentation involved so this will emerge as I go along with updates here.
