It sounds very meta but I thought I would have a go at sketching out the 
workflow I use when I create a sketchnote as an aide memoire for a talk I'm 
going to give.

The steps are roughly in this order (in case you can't read my writing):

* Think of the presentation subject
* Brainstorm the major points as a mind map
* Refine this list into a set of ordered chunks that will be my script
* "Act" the script in an "Italian Run Through"
* At the same time, make a rough sketchnote of the presentation
* Refine the "act" and the sketchnote together
* Embellish the finished sketchnote with details I want to make sure to bring out during the talk
* Scan the drawing for archiving later
* Throw away my written notes
* Take the sketchnote to the presentation
* Profit!

Here's the finished article:
