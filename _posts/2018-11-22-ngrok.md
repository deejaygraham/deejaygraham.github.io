A new tool (to me) is <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> a command line tool and 
online service to allow you to map an external url to a local server behind a NAT or firewall.

It does require sign up to the service but free accounts are available but these use random 
urls under the ngrok.io domain. 

If you start a local developer machine web service or api you can run the command line ngrok 
and tell it to map it's generated url to a local host url and port number. 

NGrok can be started with just the details of the port number you want forwarded. The console 
(with some details redacted) looks like this:

Once ngrok is running, it works pretty much as you would expect, with a summary of the latest 
few hits to the service. If you want more detail and want to be able to dig into a request, you 
can use a local server instance created by ngrok to examine traffic. 

This has made some awkward Azure-hosted website development in .Net core much easier when I can run 
the service locally and debug while responding to external requests. Triffic! :)
