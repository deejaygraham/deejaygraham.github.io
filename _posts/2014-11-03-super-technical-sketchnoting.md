After I posted some of my sketchnotes from <a href="http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/">DDD North</a> 
I got some very nice feedback from people on Twitter. One conversation with 
[Richard Dalton](http://www.twitter.com/RichardADalton) we got talking about 
the differences in approach between presentations with non-technical and 
technical content. The upshot of which was he challenged me to sketchnote a talk
from [Tom Stuart](http://www.twitter.com/tomstuart) with an unbelievable amount 
of technical detail.

You can see the talk [here](http://rubymanor.org/3/videos/programming_with_nothing/). 

As you will begin to understand from watching the video, there is a fair amount of 
ruby code and it quickly deteriates into almost machine code levels of detail! 

Clearly I didn't have a hope of capturing all the detail so I took the approach of 
concentrating on the high level concepts and trying to explain the overall picture - 
starting from a fairly simple (but hard to diagram) example and breaking off pieces 
around the outside. 

For me, the most important points are captured from the beginning and the end of the talk,
with enough detail in the middle to remind you how complicated it got without trying 
to capture everything.

I posted a snap of the sketchnote to twitter and Tom was kind enough to reply:
