<blockquote>
<p>
Fifteen hundred years ago, Constantine, who murdered his own wife and children, started the Christian religion.
</p><p>
From that day to this that religion has been the greatest curse that ever afflicted the earth.
</p><p>
This religion teaches that 6,000 years ago God made the first man out of dust – not even mud – and the first woman out of a bone; that God cursed the whole human race because a snake made the woman eat an apple; that God had a son by another man’s wife, and that he had this son murdered in order to keep himself from sending all the human race to hell.
</p><p>
This son taught that any man who did not believe that piece of ignorance and priestly lying would go to hell and burn eternally in fire and brimstone.
</p><p>
The Bible, in which these things are taught, favors drunkenness, murder, slavery, lying, stealing and lechery.
