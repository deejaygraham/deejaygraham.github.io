A few months back I was lucky enough to be accepted by [Paul Klipp](https://twitter.com/paulklipp) as one 
of the people to produce a sketchnote of a talk from the [ACE! 2014](http://aceconf.com) 
conference to be included in the conference proceedings along with slides and 
transcripts of the talks.

Being one of the last to find out about this opportunity, I soon discovered that 
pretty much all of the talks had already been claimed. The one remaining talk 
was from [Tom Gilb](http://www.gilb.com) 's keynote. The main challenge was 
that Tom's talks are always very information rich as a consequence of his 
data-driven approach to agile and process improvement. I went through 4 or 
5 drafts of the sketchnote before I was happy I had all the main points in 
the right order. I don't know what I would have done if I had to do it "live".

Paul declared the project 99% complete today [on leanpub](https://leanpub.com/ACE2014) 
so I'm going to share a lo-fi version of my sketchnote here. 

Paul worked hard on organizing the conference and creating the conference 
proceedings so please donate to the cost of producing the ebook if you are able.

All of the talks are worthwhile listening to and the ebook not only has 
all the sketchnotes but comes with a transcription of each talk and many 
of them have embedded slides.
