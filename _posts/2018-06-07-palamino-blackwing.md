Ever on the look out for new sketchnoting supplies, we find a new stationary shop just opened in 
Barnard Castle. Inside my wife found the legendary Palamino Blackwing pencil and bought one for me.

I had heard about the pencil before but was really surprised to find out that it makes a cameo appearance 
opposite Richard Dreyfuss in an early scene from one of our favourite movies, Jaws.
