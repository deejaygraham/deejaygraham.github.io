There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.
You built a factory out there - good for you.

But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads 
the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to 
educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and 
fire services that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry 
that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory.

Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - 
God bless ! Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social 
contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid 
who comes along.
