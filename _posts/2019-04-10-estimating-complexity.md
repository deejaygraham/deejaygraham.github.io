I really like (and find endlessly useful) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunivore">Liz Keogh's</a> scale for 
<a href="https://lizkeogh.com/2013/07/21/estimating-complexity/">estimating complexity of work</a>.

<ol>
<li>Just about everyone in the world has done this - a JFDI* task</li>
<li>Lots of people have done this, including someone on our team.</li>
<li>Someone in our company has done this, or we have access to expertise.</li>
<li>Someone in the world did this, but not in our organization - and we don't know how</li>
<li>Nobody in the world has ever done this before. - Spike or experimentation needed</li>
</ol>


*JFDI - Just Flipping Do It. Something well understood that has no complexity or dependency on externality, 
just needs the time to physically do it.
