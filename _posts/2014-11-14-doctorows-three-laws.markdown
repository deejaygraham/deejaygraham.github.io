This illustration is based on a composite of a number of different talks 
given by [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/) on the general theme of 
[The Coming War on General Purpose Computing](http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/lockdown.html) 
which he writes and talks about when not writing wonderful fiction.
