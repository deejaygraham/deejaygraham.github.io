I had the pleasure of attending a discussion on copyright - "Copying Right or Wrong?" - at Newcastle 
Central Library on the 27th of April 2015. The speakers were Rebecca Moosavian, a Senior Lecturer from 
[Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) and the author and activist 
[Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com).

Here are a selection of quotes (to come later) and photos* from the evening:
