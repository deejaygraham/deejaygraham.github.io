Continuing the theme of tiny 11ty shortcodes, using [Bulma](http://bulma.io) as my preferred css framework 
I needed a way to hide some boilerplate html markup behind a shortcode so that the markdown is a little nicer
and I can pass some variables to the function for customization.

In this example, the shortcode is a warning box: a div with some bulma-specific styling so that it can create a border,
change the background colour and add a nice icon to top left. The title table and content of the div are supplied by the 
caller. In a paired shortcode, the content comes from whatever is in between the start and end tags of the shortcode and 
whatever else needs to be passed in comes as arguments after the start of the shortcode markup, within the moustache.

### _1tty/shortcodes/warning.js 

```js

/**
 * Warning - box with an icon, title and content used to call out specific issues to the developer.
 * 
 * {% warning 'Watch out for this' %}
 * Don't write broken code!
 * {% endwarning %}
 * 
 */
module.exports = function (content, label) {
    return `<div class="notification is-warning warning-box"><p class="title is-4">${label}</p>${content}</div>`;
};

```

and in the markdown the name of the sortcode needs to appear bookended by moustaches.
